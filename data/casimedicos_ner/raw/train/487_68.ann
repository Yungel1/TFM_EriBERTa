T1	Premise 103 264	a 30-year-old woman who consults because she is a carrier of a premutation in the FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome, and who wishes to have offspring
T2	Claim 299 379	All her male children will be carriers and, therefore, will manifest the disease
T3	Marker 343 352	therefore
T4	Claim 384 495	There is a phenomenon of genetic anticipation, so their offspring will present more severe and earlier symptoms
T5	Marker 431 433	so
T6	Claim 500 648	Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex selection of embryos by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the best option for healthy offspring
T7	Claim 653 751	50% of her daughters will be carriers, but will not present clinical manifestations of the disease
T8	Marker 692 695	but
T9	Claim 928 1312	Triplet expansion diseases, such as this one, can have the anticipation phenomenon whereby females with premutations (between 55-200 repeats) can have children with full mutations (more than 200 repeats of the triplet) and more obvious, more severe and/or earlier clinical, in both males and females (Fragile X syndrome, early ovarian failure, tremor/ataxia associated with Fragile X)
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T4	
T10	Claim 778 844	Another classic MIR, asked in 2019 and in 2017, fragile X syndrome
T11	Claim 846 926	Also, on the same concept as question 44, the phenomenon of genetic anticipation
T12	Marker 846 850	Also
R2	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T4	
T13	Disease 826 844	fragile X syndrome
