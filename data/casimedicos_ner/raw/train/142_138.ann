T19	Diagnostics 803 856	Determine ceruloplasmin and copper in blood and urine
T20	Claim 876 1172	In fact, I would not test this patient at this time, and I would check if the transaminase level has normalized at a later time, since the most frequent cause, at least in children, is a transient elevation in the context of viral diseases (most frequently cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus)
T21	Claim 1174 1286	The minimal elevation of liver enzymes and the fact that it has a normal protein profile goes against chronicity

T25	Disease 1515 1529	celiac disease
T22	Claim 1290 1372	If I had to choose I would choose answer 5, which seems to me the least aggressive
R1	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T17	
T26	Claim 1378 1581	if I had to do analytical tests I would add the determination of alpha-1-antitrypsin (without CT) and markers of celiac disease, because celiac disease can also be associated with some hypertransaminemia
