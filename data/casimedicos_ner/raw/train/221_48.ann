T1	Premise 50 335	A 20-year-old man with ataxia, headaches and solid-cystic mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere underwent surgery and a lesion was resected, histologically showing cells with long thin cytoplasmic processes, fascicular and microcystic pattern, numerous vessels and Rosenthal's fibers
T2	Claim 390 411	Pilocytic astrocytoma
T3	Claim 416 445	Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma
T4	Claim 450 469	Central neurocytoma
T5	Claim 474 489	Liponeurocytoma
T6	Claim 494 507	Prion disease
T7	Claim 621 696	The statement concisely summarizes the description of pilocytic astrocytoma
T8	Disease 675 696	pilocytic astrocytoma
R1	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T2	
T9	Claim 867 1030	the cell morphology described (long and thin cytoplasmic processes, which are the ones that give the name "pilocytic") keeps us the first option as the correct one
T10	Premise 898 984	long and thin cytoplasmic processes, which are the ones that give the name "pilocytic"
T11	Claim 698 861	The Rosenthal fibers may confuse us as they are not very specific, and make us think, for example, of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma in which they can also be found
