T1	Premise 68 162	A 62-year-old man comes to the hospital emergency department with a fever of 38.3″C and chills
T2	Premise 164 196	He is tachycardic and tachypneic
T3	Premise 198 239	Blood tests: leukocytosis with left shift
T4	Premise 241 269	Blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg
T5	Premise 271 351	No murmurs are heard on cardiac auscultation and chest X-ray rules out pneumonia
T6	Premise 353 420	As history of interest she refers repeated urinary tract infections
T7	Premise 422 512	A week ago the primary care physician prescribed cefuroxime, a drug he is currently taking
T8	Premise 514 615	Two blood cultures were taken and urine was sent for sediment examination and microbiological culture
T9	Premise 617 690	The sediment was pathological, with intense pyuria, but negative nitrites
T10	Premise 692 903	After 24 hours, the microbiology laboratory reported that both the urine and the blood cultures were positive, and the results showed gram-positive cocci grouped in chains, pending identification and antibiogram
T11	Claim 965 1137	Continue with cefuroxime while awaiting the definitive result, since the patient has undergone multiple treatments and we should not make a mistake in his current treatment
T12	Claim 1142 1223	Change to ertapenem, considering the possibility of multiresistant microorganisms
T13	Claim 1228 1307	Switch to a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment that covers Enterococcus spp
T14	Claim 1312 1515	Switch to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy containing imipenem, considering the possibility of Staphylococcus aureus, since our hospital has a high incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)
T15	Premise 1542 1617	With the urine nitrite test we detect the presence of nitrites in the urine
T16	Marker 1434 1439	since
T17	Marker 1028 1033	since
T18	Claim 1619 1816	These appear due to the presence in the urine of a high concentration of bacteria possessing the enzyme nitrate reductase, which is capable of reducing the nitrates present in the urine to nitrites
T19	Marker 1632 1638	due to
T20	Claim 1818 1950	This enzyme is active in most of the bacteria that most frequently cause urinary tract infection, such as many Gram-negative bacilli
T21	Claim 1952 2129	Other microorganisms, relatively frequent causes of urinary tract infection, do not possess this enzyme and do not reduce nitrates, such as enterococci, staphylococci and yeasts
R1	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T20	
R2	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T21	
T22	Claim 2131 2313	As the Gram stain indicates that the bacteria are grouped in chains, as this is typical of enterococcus, we suggest the need to cover this group of bacteria with antibiotic treatment
R3	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T22	
R4	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T13	
T23	Claim 2315 2412	Staphylococci are typically seen on Gram stain as Gram-positive cocci forming clusters and yeasts
T24	Claim 2414 2507	although with the same staining, have a different typical morphology than Gram-positive cocci
T25	Marker 2414 2422	although
T26	Treatment 1228 1307	Switch to a broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment that covers Enterococcus spp
T27	Disease 965 1026	Continue with cefuroxime while awaiting the definitive result
T28	Treatment 1142 1223	Change to ertapenem, considering the possibility of multiresistant microorganisms
T29	Treatment 1312 1432	Switch to broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy containing imipenem, considering the possibility of Staphylococcus aureus
