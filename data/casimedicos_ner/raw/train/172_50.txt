QUESTION TYPE: PNEUMOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A patient with severe COPD comes to the ED with an acute onset and presents an arterial blood gas drawn with Fi02 of 31% at sea level with a Pa02 of 86 mm Hg, PaC02 65 mm Hg, pH 7.13 and Bicarbonate 27 mmol/liter. Which of the following statements is FALSE?
1- The patient is hyperventilating.
2- The alveolar arterial oxygen gradient is elevated.
3- The patient is in respiratory acidosis.
4- Bicarbonate level is normal.
5- Initiation of mechanical ventilation should be considered.
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Blood gas analysis shows an acute respiratory acidosis, due to an increase in PCO2 of short evolution time because the kidney has not yet had time to retain bicarbonates (bicarbonate level at the high limit of normality). The patient is not hyperventilating but hypoventilating because PCO2 is elevated. The alveolar arterial oxygen gradient is altered since the patient has a normal PaO2, but because he has a high FiO2. If he were without oxygen, he would be hypoxemic. Respiratory acidosis below 7.20 is a reason to consider noninvasive mechanical ventilation acutely and in principle temporarily in a patient with severe COPD.
