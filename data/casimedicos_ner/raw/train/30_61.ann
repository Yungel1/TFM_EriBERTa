T1	Claim 574 650	Increase oxygen flow because he has acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia
T2	Claim 655 794	I would initiate noninvasive mechanical ventilation because he has acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with moderate respiratory acidosis
T3	Claim 799 869	I would add sodium bicarbonate to correct the acute metabolic acidosis
T4	Claim 874 984	The patient does not have respiratory insufficiency so he would continue with the same pharmacological regimen
T5	Claim 989 1099	I would add intravenous aminophylline as a respiratory stimulant, since I appreciate hypoxemia and hypercapnia
T6	Claim 2438 2446	1: Wrong
T7	Premise 2448 2564	he is a "retentive" patient and increasing O2 flow is highly likely to increase hypercapnia and, therefore, acidosis
T8	Treatment 574 594	Increase oxygen flow
T9	Disease 610 636	acute respiratory acidosis
T10	Treatment 663 706	initiate noninvasive mechanical ventilation
T11	Disease 722 794	acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with moderate respiratory acidosis
T12	Disease 845 869	acute metabolic acidosis
T13	Treatment 807 829	add sodium bicarbonate
T14	Treatment 938 984	continue with the same pharmacological regimen
T15	Treatment 997 1053	add intravenous aminophylline as a respiratory stimulant
T16	Disease 1074 1083	hypoxemia
T17	Disease 1088 1099	hypercapnia
T18	Disease 886 925	does not have respiratory insufficiency

T19	Claim 2566 2602	2: We will keep this one as correct.
T20	Claim 2603 2636	3: It is not a metabolic acidosis
T21	Premise 2638 2759	the bicarbonate is not decreased, on the contrary, it is slightly increased trying to compensate the respiratory acidosis
R2	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T20	
T22	Claim 3084 3209	5: At present and -as already mentioned- taking into account that there is no formal contraindication, it is not usually used
T23	Claim 2315 2436	We have nothing "against" theophylline (we are not told of any contraindication), but nowadays it is rare to resort to it
T24	Claim 2761 2868	4: He does not reach respiratory failure by definition (pO2 60), but he has hypercapnia and slight acidosis
T25	Premise 2870 3010	If we knew the first blood gas and she was much worse (i.e. she was doing very well), continuing with the same medication would be an option
T26	Premise 3012 3039	but this data is missing!!!

T27	Claim 1219 1247	three answers could be valid
T28	Premise 1249 1389	The trap is that they give us the initial clinical picture WITHOUT GASOMETRY and then they give us the blood gases afterwards WITHOUT CLINIC
T29	Marker 1391 1393	so
T30	Marker 1484 1486	so
T31	Claim 1394 1482	there is no way of knowing what the evolution of the patient has been with our treatment
T32	Claim 1487 1522	it is impossible to know what to do

T33	Premise 1524 1717	If the patient initially came with a blood gas with a pH of 7.05 and now has the one we are given, we are doing well (although we are not told the time interval between one thing and the other)
T34	Claim 1723 1795	in this case, it could be worthwhile to continue with the same treatment
R8	Support Ent1:T33 Ent2:T34	
T35	Premise 1797 1900	If nothing has evolved, the clinical picture is the same and the blood gas at the beginning was similar
T36	Claim 1902 1926	something should be done
R9	Support Ent1:T35 Ent2:T36	
T37	Claim 2012 2112	If we decide to do something, at present we might decide to use ventilation rather than theophylline
T38	Premise 2114 2313	although with "so little" alteration of pH (and even more so if we think that this is a chronic patient who may have a baseline blood gas similar to the one presented to us) it may seem "exaggerated"

T39	Premise 62 240	A patient previously diagnosed with COPD comes to the emergency room for 3 days with increased dyspnea until he is at rest, cough with whitish expectoration and marked drowsiness
T40	Premise 242 462	After receiving treatment with oxygen at low concentrations, bronchodilators and coticoids, a second arterial blood gas with 28% inspiratory oxygen fraction shows a pH of 7.32, pO2 61 mmHg, pCO2 58 mmHg, HCO3- 29 mmol/l.
