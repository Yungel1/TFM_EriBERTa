QUESTION TYPE: GENERAL SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 35-year-old woman is diagnosed with colon cancer located in the hepatic angle. She has a family history of colon cancer in her mother, an aunt at the age of 45 and a grandfather. The most accepted surgical intervention is:
1- Right hemicolectomy.
2- Extended right hemicolectomy.
3- Subtotal colectomy.
4- Total colectomy with ileorectal anatomosis.
5- Total colectomy with ileoanal anatomy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
The statement with the family history indicates that this is a case of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome). The age and right location data lead us to answer 4: total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. If a conventional right hemicolectomy type surgery is performed, the chances of recurrence are higher than 30%. Excision of the rectum is not necessary prophylactically.
