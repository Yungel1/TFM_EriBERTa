T1	Premise 69 163	A 62-year-old patient who has had a pericardial bioprosthesis in mitral position for two years
T2	Premise 165 216	He is admitted urgently for acute coronary syndrome
T3	Premise 218 328	Two days later and after a favorable evolution, he suddenly presented heart failure with acute pulmonary edema
T4	Claim 409 451	Acute post-infarction mitral insufficiency
T5	Claim 456 481	Left ventricular aneurysm
T6	Claim 486 517	Acute ventricular septal defect
T7	Claim 522 557	Postinfarction atrial septal defect
T8	Claim 562 629	Dysfunction of the bioprosthesis due to probable acute endocarditis
T9	Disease 409 451	Acute post-infarction mitral insufficiency
T10	Disease 456 481	Left ventricular aneurysm
T11	Disease 486 517	Acute ventricular septal defect
T12	Disease 522 557	Postinfarction atrial septal defect
T13	Disease 562 594	Dysfunction of the bioprosthesis
T14	Marker 595 601	due to
T15	Disease 611 629	acute endocarditis
T16	Claim 649 776	The valve is biological and, in general, the veils are not sewn to the papillary muscles, so we don't care what happens to them
T17	Marker 739 741	so
T18	Claim 778 855	A ventricular aneurysm depresses LVEF, but does not suddenly put you into PAD
T19	Marker 817 820	but
R1	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T5	
T20	Claim 857 1003	In contrast, a VSD sharply increases flow to the pulmonary bed, causing pulmonary edema, and is also one of the most frequent complications of AMI
T21	Marker 857 868	In contrast
R2	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T6	
R3	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T20	
T22	Claim 1005 1096	Ischemic ASD... I do not deny that it exists, but it does not even appear in the guidelines
T23	Marker 1051 1054	but
T24	Claim 1098 1151	And endocarditis would not require so many saddlebags
R4	Attack Ent1:T24 Ent2:T8	
R5	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T7
