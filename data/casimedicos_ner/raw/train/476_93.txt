QUESTION TYPE: CRITICAL CARE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 58-year-old hypertensive man comes to the emergency department for a 30-second syncope while jogging, with spontaneous recovery and no sequelae. Blood pressure is 135/65 mmHg. Cardiac auscultation shows a loud, intense systolic murmur, which is reduced with Valsalva maneuvers and an attenuated second tone. The ECG shows sinus rhythm at 72 bpm, with criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy and inverted T waves in anterior face. Point out the correct statement:
1- The clinical picture suggests pulmonary thromboembolism.
2- The data provided indicate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.
3- These data correspond to severe aortic stenosis.
4- Aortic dissection should be excluded by contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The data provided on the characteristics of the murmur (it DECREASES with Valsalva) and the data on left ventricular hypertrophy, lead us to the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis.
