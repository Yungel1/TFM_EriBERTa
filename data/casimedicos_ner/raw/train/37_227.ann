T4	Premise 274 326	Mobilization of the shoulders and hips produces pain
T5	Premise 328 390	There are no alterations on palpation of the temporal arteries
T6	Premise 409 487	hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL ferritin 450 ng/mL erythrocyte sedimentation rate 115 mm/h
T7	Claim 555 604	Request a Doppler ultrasound of temporal arteries
T8	Claim 609 680	Start treatment with prednisone 60mg per day and aspirin 100 mg per day
T9	Claim 685 730	Start treatment with prednisone 10 mg per day
T10	Claim 735 767	Request a temporal artery biopsy
T11	Claim 772 814	Request a brain magnetic resonance imaging
T12	Claim 834 912	The clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA)
T13	Premise 919 979	febrile fever, shoulder girdle and pelvic pain, and headache
T14	Premise 981 1023	Age and sex also point to this possibility
R1	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T12	
R2	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T12	
T15	Claim 1025 1151	Abrupt unilateral visual loss with pale papillary edema is highly indicative of arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy due to GCA
T16	Premise 1153 1172	The ESR is elevated
R3	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T15	
T17	Claim 1213 1263	We have to quickly start corticosteroid treatment.
R4	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T17	
R5	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T17	
T18	Claim 1264 1295	We can already rule out 1 and 5
T19	Marker 1296 1303	because
T20	Premise 1304 1335	they do not contribute anything
R6	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T18	
T21	Claim 1838 1913	if we rule out 3 because the dose is too low, we would have to stay with 2.
T22	Marker 1844 1852	rule out

R8	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T11	
R9	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T9	
R10	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T8	
T23	Claim 1337 1522	4 could make us doubt, and it is true that we will have to ask for a temporal artery biopsy, but that is not immediate: the statement makes it very clear that we have to act immediately
R11	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T10	
T24	Claim 1914 1972	With reservations, since aspirin has a rather dubious role
R12	Attack Ent1:T24 Ent2:T21	
T25	Claim 1524 1592	The current trend is to use megadoses of intravenous corticosteroids
R13	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T21	
T26	Diagnostics 565 604	Doppler ultrasound of temporal arteries
T27	Treatment 609 680	Start treatment with prednisone 60mg per day and aspirin 100 mg per day
T28	Treatment 685 730	Start treatment with prednisone 10 mg per day
T30	Diagnostics 780 814	a brain magnetic resonance imaging
T31	Claim 1174 1211	which further clarifies the diagnosis
R14	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T31	
R15	Support Ent1:T31 Ent2:T15	
T32	Marker 1430 1433	but
T33	Marker 1598 1606	although
T34	Claim 1598 1754	although aspirin has traditionally been proposed to reduce ischemic events, the evidence currently indicates that antiplatelet agents do not contribute much
R16	Support Ent1:T34 Ent2:T21	
T35	Marker 1827 1836	Therefore
T36	Claim 1756 1825	An oral corticosteroid dose of around 1mg/kg would also be acceptable
T29	Diagnostics 745 767	temporal artery biopsy
T37	Disease 886 912	giant cell arteritis (GCA)
T38	Disease 1025 1054	Abrupt unilateral visual loss
T39	Disease 1060 1080	pale papillary edema
T40	Disease 1105 1151	arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy due to GCA
T41	Marker 1279 1287	rule out
T42	Marker 1933 1938	since
T43	Premise 1982 2064	corticosteroid dose remains ambiguous (we do not know how much the patient weighs)
