T1	Premise 42 254	A patient with severe COPD comes to the ED with an acute onset and presents an arterial blood gas drawn with Fi02 of 31% at sea level with a Pa02 of 86 mm Hg, PaC02 65 mm Hg, pH 7.13 and Bicarbonate 27 mmol/liter
T2	Claim 303 334	The patient is hyperventilating
T3	Claim 339 388	The alveolar arterial oxygen gradient is elevated
T4	Claim 393 431	The patient is in respiratory acidosis
T5	Claim 436 463	Bicarbonate level is normal
T6	Claim 468 525	Initiation of mechanical ventilation should be considered
T7	Treatment 482 504	mechanical ventilation
T8	Disease 411 431	respiratory acidosis
T9	Claim 545 765	Blood gas analysis shows an acute respiratory acidosis, due to an increase in PCO2 of short evolution time because the kidney has not yet had time to retain bicarbonates (bicarbonate level at the high limit of normality)
T10	Marker 601 607	due to
T11	Marker 652 659	because
T12	Diagnostics 121 139	arterial blood gas
T13	Diagnostics 545 563	Blood gas analysis
T14	Disease 64 68	COPD

R2	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T4	
T15	Claim 767 847	The patient is not hyperventilating but hypoventilating because PCO2 is elevated
R3	Attack Ent1:T15 Ent2:T2	
R4	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T15	
T16	Claim 849 965	The alveolar arterial oxygen gradient is altered since the patient has a normal PaO2, but because he has a high FiO2
T17	Marker 898 903	since
T18	Marker 935 946	but because

T19	Claim 967 1015	If he were without oxygen, he would be hypoxemic
R7	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T5	
T20	Claim 1017 1174	Respiratory acidosis below 7.20 is a reason to consider noninvasive mechanical ventilation acutely and in principle temporarily in a patient with severe COPD
