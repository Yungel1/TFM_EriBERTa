T1	Claim 573 629	Immediate systemic fibrinolysis at the regional hospital
T2	Claim 634 705	Immediate transfer to a tertiary center for treatment with fibrinolysis
T3	Claim 710 803	Immediate transfer to a tertiary center for percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure
T4	Claim 808 874	Hemodynamic stabilization and deferred revascularization procedure
T5	Claim 879 930	Immediate treatment with fondaparinux and abciximab
T6	Premise 77 132	A 72-year-old man, ex-smoker, hypertensive and diabetic
T7	Premise 134 202	History of stroke with residual paresis in the left arm 4 months ago
T8	Premise 204 316	He comes to the emergency department of a regional hospital with intense precordial pain of 2 hours of evolution
T9	Premise 318 378	in the physical examination he presents cold and sweaty skin
T10	Premise 380 406	blood pressure of 80 mm Hg
T11	Premise 408 484	electrocardiogram with marked ST segment elevation in leads V1-V6, I and aVL
T12	Treatment 573 604	Immediate systemic fibrinolysis
T13	Treatment 678 705	treatment with fibrinolysis
T14	Treatment 754 803	percutaneous coronary revascularization procedure
T15	Treatment 808 833	Hemodynamic stabilization
T16	Treatment 838 874	deferred revascularization procedure
T17	Treatment 879 930	Immediate treatment with fondaparinux and abciximab
T18	Premise 998 1097	To begin with, this is a patient with an extensive anterior and lateral AMI, with cardiogenic shock
T19	Marker 998 1011	To begin with
T20	Premise 1099 1188	On the other hand, in the history, we are told that the patient had a stroke 4 months ago
T21	Marker 1099 1116	On the other hand
T22	Claim 1190 1323	It is evident from the patient's clinical picture that an urgent reperfusion strategy is indicated, which invalidates options 4 and 5
R1	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T4	
R2	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T5	
T23	Claim 1493 1526	Option 2 does not make much sense
R3	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T2	
T24	Marker 1528 1533	since
T25	Premise 1528 1632	since in the event that fibrinolysis is indicated, it would only be a waste of time to make the transfer
R4	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T23	
T26	Marker 1955 1964	Therefore
T27	Claim 1966 1989	the correct answer is 3
R5	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T3	
T28	Claim 1634 1807	A history of stroke (presumably ischemic) 4 months ago is a relative contraindication for fibrinolysis (if the time is less than 3 months it is an absolute contraindication)
R6	Attack Ent1:T28 Ent2:T1	
T29	Marker 1809 1812	but
T30	Premise 1813 1953	the definitive factor that tips the balance towards PCI is the extent of AMI and the presence of shock, which are indications for urgent PCI
R7	Support Ent1:T30 Ent2:T27	
R8	Support Ent1:T30 Ent2:T3	
R9	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T22	
R10	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T22
