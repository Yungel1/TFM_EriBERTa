QUESTION TYPE: CRITICAL CARE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 22-year-old woman presents with sudden cardiac arrest with a rhythm that is considered amenable to defibrillation. Chest compressions and ventilations are being performed, a defibrillator shock has been delivered, and a peripheral venous line has been cannulated. Which of the following would be correct next:
1- Administration of 150 mg of intravenous amiodarone.
2- Administration of 300 mg of intravenous amiodarone.
3- Administration of 1 mg of intravenous atropine.
4- Administer 2 mg of intravenous atropine.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Controversial question, since amiodarone (the dose is correct, 300mg), is administered after the third shock, and not after the first defibrillation, which is what we are told in the statement. Although, be careful, that is what the guidelines say. I am sure that more than one of us has administered amiodarone as soon as we have had venous access available in the event of a shockable rhythm. The other options are incorrect.
