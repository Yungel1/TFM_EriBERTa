QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 65-year-old woman referred to the emergency department for fever and alterations in the laboratory tests: hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL, leukocytes 0.86 x103/μL,(neutrophils 41.9%, lymphocytes 55.8%),platelets 48.0 x103/μL, fibrinogen 118 mg/dL,D-dimer 20.2 μg/mL. Bone marrow examination was performed and she was diagnosed with acute leukemia with t(15;17) in 60% of the cells. Which of the following answers is correct?
1- If asymptomatic, transretinoic acid (ATRA) will be started and day hospital controls will be recommended.
2- Start treatment with arsenic trioxide, ATRA and supportive therapy.
3- It is a myeloblastic leukemia type M3, so chemotherapy and heparin will be started to control disseminated intravascular coagulation.
4- Antibiotic treatment should be started. When the fever disappears, leukemia treatment should be started.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
It is a definitive promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17), and as it is well known by all of you the treatment is with arsenic trioxide + ATRA. Option 1 leaves the treatment incomplete, there is only ATRA and it must be treated as long as the patient's condition allows it, whether or not there are symptoms. Option 3 3 years ago would have been the correct option but nowadays neither chemotherapy nor heparin is used. And option 4 is false because that fever is due to the leukemia itself and the priority is to start specific treatment for leukemia.
