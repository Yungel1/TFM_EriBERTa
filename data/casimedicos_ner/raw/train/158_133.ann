T13	Claim 760 973	This picture should automatically lead us to mark epiphysiolysis capitis femoris (proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, the fact of reading it in Latin nomina is a bit of a misunderstanding but it should not mislead us

R6	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T5	
T18	Claim 1069 1206	The other options are not impossible but they are less frequent and they would not ask us this if they wanted us to choose another option
T19	Marker 1106 1109	but
T20	Claim 1208 1322	If they were sequelae of hip dysplasia, it would not have this 4-month onset and the age of onset would be earlier

R11	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T7	
T26	Claim 1590 1720	In a child the most typical would be a fracture at the level of the physis, not at the level of the femoral neck, so we discard 3.

T27	Marker 1704 1706	so
T28	Claim 1721 1871	For us to consider this option we would have to have been presented with a bone cyst, something that would justify a weakness in the femoral neck area

T32	Marker 2110 2117	because
T33	Claim 2072 2485	Perhaps we could think about this one because they talk about pain in the right knee, but this picture that they present us is limited to the right lower limb, they do not talk about other joints or fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms, so it is not an option to evaluate, especially with the other options presented to us that would be more likely in view of the picture presented to us (option 1 false)
