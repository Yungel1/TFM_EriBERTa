T1	Premise 45 163	A patient is brought to the ED from a fire occurring inside an enclosed building where polyurethane foams were present
T2	Premise 165 256	He is conscious, but presents with increasing mental dullness, headache, and severe dyspnea
T3	Premise 258 337	Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is 92% and capillary lactic acid is 8 mEq/l
T4	Claim 400 460	Administration of oxygen by means of a 50% Venturi type mask
T5	Claim 465 511	Administration of intravenous hydroxycobalamin
T6	Claim 516 551	Ventilation with hyperbaric chamber
T7	Claim 556 627	Fluid therapy with infusion of physiological saline solution at 21 ml/h
T8	Claim 654 796	The first thing we need to know is that combustion of polyurethane at high temperature results in the release of cyanide (very intuitive, yes)
T9	Claim 798 895	Knowing this, and that we are dealing with cyanide poisoning, it is easier to answer the question
R1	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T9	
T10	Claim 897 1077	Among the basic initial treatment measures would be the administration of oxygen therapy with FiO2 1 (not 0.5 as stated in option 1), and an antidote, in this case hydroxycobalamin

R6	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T7	
T19	Claim 1299 1412	in case of associated shock, volume would be administered, but in any case not at that rate, but in rapid boluses
T20	Marker 1358 1361	but
