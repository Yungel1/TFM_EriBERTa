CLINICAL CASE: 
A 58-year-old man comes for a scheduled check-up for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 6 years ago. He has a personal history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease and pancreatitis of biliary origin. His medication includes lisinopril, metoprolol, metformin, ASA and atorvastatin. Physical examination showed blood pressure 151/93 mmHg, BMI 27.1 kg/m2. Glycated hemoglobin is 8.3%. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
1- Empaglifozin.
2- Glipizide.
3- Acarbose.
4- Sitagliptin.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Patient with obesity, hypertension and increased HbA1C. In recent studies, Empaglifozin, a highly selective inhibitor of SGLT210, significantly reduces AT, HbA1C and BMI. Glipizide is of the sulfonylurea group. Its use should be avoided in patients with heart disease. Acarbose can interact with beta-blockers, such as those taken by our patient. Sitagliptin has been shown to decrease HbA1C but not HT or BMI.
