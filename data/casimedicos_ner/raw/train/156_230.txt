QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 40-year-old patient who comes to the emergency room with aphthous stomatitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis, balanitis and joint pain. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?
1- Behçet's disease.
2- Reactive arthritis syndrome.
3- Sweet's syndrome.
4- Vitamin A deficiency.
5- Gonococcal infection.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Given this clinical picture and without having complementary tests available, the most likely diagnosis is reactive arthritis. The only problem is that the statement speaks of joint pain and not arthritis... Reiter's syndrome (triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis) is one of the forms in which reactive arthritis can present. In Behçet's disease oral and genital aphthous ulcers may occur but urethritis is not a feature. And the characteristic ocular condition is uveitis.
