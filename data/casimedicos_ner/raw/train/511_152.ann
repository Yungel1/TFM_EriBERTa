T3	Premise 302 382	Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, both without macroscopic alterations
T4	Premise 384 691	Duodenal biopsies were normal, while colon biopsies showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria with an irregular band of collagen immediately below the mucosal surface epithelium with a thickness greater than 10 mm and a number of intraepithelial lymphocytes >20 per 100 epithelial cells

T10	Claim 1105 1311	In our case, the patient presents findings compatible with collagenous colitis (band of collagen underlying the epithelium greater than 10 microns) and lymphocytic (more than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes)
