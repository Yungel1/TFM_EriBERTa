QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 45-year-old woman, mother of 3 children, attends an early diagnosis consultation. Cervicovaginal cytology is compatible with a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Which of the following options would you choose?
1- Repeat cytology in 1 month.
2- Colposcopy with possible biopsy.
3- Hysterectomy with bilateral salpinguectomy and ovarian conservation.
4- Fractionated uterine curettage.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The correct answer is 2. According to the 2014 SEGO Oncoguide on cervical cancer prevention, when a cytology shows a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, the action to be taken is a colposcopy, with or without biopsy depending on the findings (regardless of the patient's age and parity).
