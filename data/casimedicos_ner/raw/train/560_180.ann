T2	Premise 249 346	The physical examination reveals cutaneous pallor and the CBC shows Hb 7.4 g/dL, Hct 31%, MCV 108
T3	Claim 434 445	Haptoglobin
T4	Claim 450 462	Coombs' test
T5	Claim 467 478	Vitamin B12
T6	Claim 483 505	Antinuclear antibodies
T7	Premise 532 608	They give to know of a patient with SLE in treatment with Hydroxychloroquine
T8	Premise 610 676	She has a hb of 7.4 and a MCV over 100, adding pallor and weakness
T9	Claim 678 722	we would be dealing with a macrocytic anemia
R1	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T9	
R2	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T9	
T10	Claim 724 779	In my opinion, the most suitable would be alternative 2
T11	Claim 781 862	since hydroxyloroquine has been reported to decrease the absorption of folic acid
T12	Marker 781 786	since
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T4	
T13	Premise 868 903	since she has a complication of SLE
T14	Marker 868 873	since
T15	Claim 905 1002	in this case, we could be dealing with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia with folic acid consumption
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T15	
R5	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T15	
R6	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T10	
T16	Claim 1004 1070	And for this it would be first to determine with the direct coombs
R7	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T16	
R8	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T4	
T17	Diagnostics 1057 1070	direct coombs
T18	Disease 705 722	macrocytic anemia
