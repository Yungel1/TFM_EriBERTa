QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
Previously healthy 10-month-old infant with acute gastroenteritis of one day's evolution and signs of mild dehydration, without blood or mucus in the stool and without oral tolerance. What is the initial treatment of choice in our environment?
1- Intravenous rehydration, absolute diet 8 hours and start feeding with astringent diet.
2- Rehydration with low osmolality oral rehydration solution (sodium 60-75 mEq/L) and continue with his usual diet.
3- Rehydration with low osmolality oral rehydration solution (sodium 60-75 mEq/L) maintain usual feeding and oral amoxicillin 10 days.
4- Rehydration with low osmolality oral rehydration solution (sodium 60-75 mEq/L) and start feeding with lactose-free formulas.
5- Rehydration with low osmolality oral rehydration solution (sodium 60-75 mEq/L) maintain usual feeding and loperamide 7 days.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The infant presents with acute GEA without signs of alarm or severe dehydration. The first step would be to try oral tolerance with oral rehydration saline and continue with normal feeding if well tolerated. Answer 1 may give rise to doubts, due to the fact that the statement says that the patient "does not tolerate the oral route". In this case, intravenous rehydration could be started... but it would not be advisable to leave the patient on an absolute diet for 8 hours, nor a subsequent astringent diet, so I prefer answer 2. The rest of the treatments do not provide any benefit.
