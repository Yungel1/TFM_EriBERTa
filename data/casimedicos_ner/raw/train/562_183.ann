T1	Premise 42 150	A 45-year-old woman with no history of interest consults for dyspneic sensation of about 4 days of evolution
T2	Premise 152 245	Examination shows rhythmic tachycardia, without murmurs, and pulmonary auscultation is normal
T3	Premise 247 313	Arterial blood gases showed a pO2 of 70 mmHg and a pCO2 of 32 mmHg
T4	Premise 315 362	Hemogram, renal and hepatic function are normal
T5	Premise 364 461	Prothrombin time 90%, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of 2 to control (N <1.2)
T6	Claim 519 544	Antiphospholipid syndrome
T7	Claim 549 567	Factor V of Leiden
T8	Claim 572 582	Hemophilia
T9	Claim 587 605	Acute pericarditis
T10	Claim 632 755	In this question what they assume is that this is a 45-year-old woman who is diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE)
T11	Disease 724 755	pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE)
T12	Claim 757 815	With this diagnosis, options 3 and 4 are directly excluded
R1	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T12	
R2	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T8	
R3	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T9	
T13	Premise 817 836	also, she is female
T14	Claim 838 884	so we would not have to think about hemophilia
T15	Marker 817 821	also
T16	Marker 838 840	so
R4	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T14	
R5	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T8	
T17	Premise 886 956	As an analytical data, it says that there is a lengthening of the aPTT
T18	Claim 958 1066	So, they want you to know, she has positive lupus ac and link it directly to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
T19	Marker 958 960	So
R6	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T18	
T20	Disease 1035 1066	antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
R7	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T6	
T21	Claim 1068 1133	A Leiden's does not alter coagulation, so it is ruled out as well
T22	Marker 1107 1109	so
T23	Marker 1116 1125	ruled out
R8	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T7	
R9	Support Ent1:T5 Ent2:T21	
T24	Claim 1135 1284	Anyway, although it is not within the possible answers, lupus positivity can be related to a myriad of clinical situations, syndromes and pathologies
T25	Marker 1135 1141	Anyway
T26	Marker 1143 1151	although
T27	Claim 1286 1409	Assuming that a PTE + lupus is a PFS seems to me to be a bit of a stretch, but it is the most likely with the data provided
T28	Marker 1361 1364	but
R10	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T6	
T29	Disease 519 544	Antiphospholipid syndrome
T30	Disease 549 567	Factor V of Leiden
T31	Disease 572 582	Hemophilia
T32	Disease 587 605	Acute pericarditis
