T1	Premise 42 212	An 82-year-old patient presents with sudden and frequent dizziness, without prodromes, of short duration and which subsides spontaneously, without ever presenting syncope
T2	Premise 214 276	Physical examination and baseline electrocardiogram are normal
T3	Premise 278 468	In an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording during 24 hours, short phases of absence of P waves prior to QRS with an escape rhythm of the atrioventricular junction with narrow QRS at 40 bpm
T4	Premise 473 580	a wave at the beginning of the ST segment corresponding to a retrograde P were detected in the vigil period
T5	Premise 582 636	No asystole periods longer than 3 seconds are detected
T6	Claim 667 737	The patient has a third-degree AVB and requires pacemaker implantation
T7	Claim 742 825	The absence of periods of asystole >3 seconds excludes a cardiac cause of dizziness
T8	Claim 830 901	Drug treatment to increase conduction in the AV node would be indicated
T9	Claim 906 1018	The patient presents sinus dysfunction with sinoatrial block and requires pacemaker implantation due to symptoms
T10	Claim 1023 1175	The alterations detected in the ambulatory electrocardiogram are typical of patients of this age and there is no indication for therapeutic intervention
T11	Claim 1643 1664	Option 1 is ruled out
T12	Claim 1666 1690	it is not a complete AVB
R1	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T11	
R2	Attack Ent1:T11 Ent2:T6	
T13	Marker 1655 1664	ruled out
T14	Claim 1692 1766	Option 2 cannot be answered either: to exclude, what is said to exclude...
R3	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T7	
T15	Claim 1767 1790	It is like never/always
R4	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T14	
T16	Claim 1792 1825	Option 3 does not make much sense
T17	Claim 1312 1359	In 10% of people there is retrograde conduction
T18	Marker 1361 1363	so
T19	Premise 1234 1310	If the sinus node fails, the AV node takes over and stimulates the ventricle
T20	Premise 1508 1601	Likewise, there are also no pauses longer than 3 seconds that could cause cardiogenic syncope
T21	Premise 1603 1640	which, in fact, he has never suffered
R5	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T20	
T22	Marker 1508 1516	Likewise
T23	Premise 1364 1479	that beat generated in the AVN stimulates both ventricles and atria, giving a retrograde P as reported in the study
T24	Claim 1827 1909	we could suspend those that impair conduction (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists)
T25	Claim 1911 2007	but drugs that facilitate, as long as we do not give him a perfusion of atropine to take home...
T26	Marker 1911 1914	but

R7	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T16	
T27	Claim 2008 2132	In option 4, stating that he has sinoatrial block is a bit of a rap: without an electrophysiological study it cannot be said
T28	Premise 2034 2057	he has sinoatrial block
R8	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T27	
T29	Premise 2134 2171	he does not necessarily have SA block
T30	Claim 2177 2239	this alone would not indicate the implantation of a pacemaker.

T31	Claim 2240 2275	So, finally, I would check option 5
R13	Support Ent1:T31 Ent2:T10	
T32	Marker 2240 2242	So
T33	Marker 2244 2251	finally
R14	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T12	
T34	Disease 685 701	third-degree AVB
T35	Treatment 715 737	pacemaker implantation
