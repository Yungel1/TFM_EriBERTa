T1	Premise 50 191	A 30-year-old woman comes to the clinic reporting anxiety, weight loss of about 6 kgs and a feeling of "nervousness" in the last three months
T2	Premise 193 269	Physical examination showed tachycardia, hyperreflexia and absence of goiter
T3	Premise 271 357	TSH values are < 0.01 microU/mL, T4 is elevated and thyroglobulin levels are decreased
T4	Premise 359 416	A scan reveals an absence of uptake in the thyroid region
T5	Claim 466 491	Factitious thyrotoxicosis
T6	Claim 496 534	Hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease
T7	Claim 539 573	Ovarian teratoma (ovarian stromal)
T8	Claim 578 598	Subacute thyroiditis
T9	Claim 625 779	Patients with this disorder voluntarily or accidentally ingest excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, resulting in hyperthyroidism in the absence of goiter
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T5	
T10	Disease 739 754	hyperthyroidism
T11	Disease 762 779	absence of goiter
R2	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T9	
R3	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T9	
T12	Claim 781 925	In contrast to all other causes of hyperthyroidism, serum thyroglobulin is not elevated and is almost always low or at the lower limit of normal
T13	Claim 816 831	hyperthyroidism
T14	Claim 927 1122	The fundamental doubt we had with ovarian teratoma (ovarian struma) which is a rare variant of mature monodermal teratoma composed of thyroid tissue described at the beginning of the 20th century
R4	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T12	
R5	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T5	
T15	Claim 1124 1266	It is so named when the teratoma is predominantly composed of mature thyroid tissue (at least 50%, in order to be classified as struma ovarii)
T16	Claim 1268 1321	It represents between 2.5 and 5% of ovarian teratomas
T17	Claim 1323 1490	In itself, it is a benign tumor, but in up to 5% of cases it can develop a malignant transformation of its elements, classically referred to as malignant struma ovarii
T18	Claim 1492 1612	Mostly, the neoplastic tissue developed is a papillary carcinoma, less frequently it corresponds to follicular carcinoma
T19	Claim 1614 1747	This malignant transformation arises mostly from classical forms of struma, but is extremely rare in cases of mature cystic teratomas
T20	Claim 1749 1905	Its behavior is similar to that of other primary ovarian tumors, tending to metastasize to the peritoneal cavity and hematogenously to bone, liver and brain
T21	Claim 1907 2056	The mean age of presentation of thyroid carcinoma on struma ovarii is between 42.9-44 years and between 21 and 63 for the papillary carcinoma variant
T22	Claim 2058 2207	Clinically, the predominant form of presentation is as a pelvic mass or abdominal pain (45%), less frequently hyperthyroidism (5-8%) or ascites (17%)
T23	Claim 2209 2323	It is postulated that the ovarian thyroid tissue in the struma is autonomous in the production of thyroid hormones
T24	Claim 2325 2486	so it is essential to measure serum thyroglobulin levels in patients affected by hyperthyroidism, as they point to the extrathyroid production of thyroid hormone
T25	Marker 2325 2327	so
T26	Marker 2423 2425	as
T27	Disease 466 491	Factitious thyrotoxicosis
T28	Disease 496 534	Hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease
T29	Marker 512 518	due to
T30	Disease 539 573	Ovarian teratoma (ovarian stromal)
T31	Disease 578 598	Subacute thyroiditis
