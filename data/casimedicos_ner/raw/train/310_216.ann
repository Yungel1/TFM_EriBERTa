T1	Premise 45 174	A parent comes to the emergency department with his 2-year-old son because he reports that he has hit his right eye while playing
T2	Premise 176 255	Indeed, a hematoma is observed on the right eyelid, apparently of no importance
T3	Premise 257 381	The fundus examination showed intraretinal hemorrhages not only in the eye referred by the parents but also in the other eye
T4	Premise 405 450	the child appears drowsy and with little tone
T5	Claim 542 590	It is a highly suggestive history of child abuse
T6	Claim 595 661	It is the normal evolution of a non-perforating intraocular trauma
T7	Claim 666 707	The most likely diagnosis is Berlin edema
T8	Claim 712 788	It is the characteristic picture of Purstcher's traumatic retinal angiopathy
T9	Premise 1044 1111	we have a blow to the right eye area, with a hematoma on the eyelid
T10	Claim 986 1031	The problem is option 4, which can confuse us
T11	Premise 1131 1336	The problem is that retinal hemorrhages appear not only in that eye (which in itself is rare, because an external blow to the eye in a child rarely causes bleeding in the retina), but also in the other eye
T12	Claim 1338 1417	Therefore, something other than the blow has caused hemorrhages in both retinas
T13	Marker 1338 1347	Therefore

T14	Premise 1419 1484	Then we are told that the child seems drowsy and with little tone
T15	Marker 1419 1423	Then
T16	Claim 1486 1658	Here we already have the two keys; we have to suspect what is not mentioned in the answers, but which is what the child has: the shaken baby syndrome (shaken baby syndrome)
T17	Marker 1578 1581	but
T18	Claim 1660 1763	Characteristic of this syndrome are bilateral retinal hemorrhages, cerebral edema and subdural hematoma

T19	Claim 1765 1824	There may also be fracture of long bones and other problems
T20	Claim 1897 1953	The cause of shaken baby syndrome is almost always abuse

T25	Premise 2013 2107	nothing indicates perforating trauma, and it does not explain the hemorrhages in the other eye
R11	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T23	
T26	Claim 2109 2228	And the berlin edema is an edema of the macula and appears as a whitish lesion, which is not described in the statement
R12	Attack Ent1:T26 Ent2:T7	
T27	Claim 2253 2388	Purstcher's retinopathy can also appear in the context of the child of the shaken child, and therefore occur in the case of child abuse
T28	Marker 2346 2355	therefore
T29	Claim 2450 2565	However, if we read answer 4 carefully, it does not tell us that if there is child maltreatment Purstcher can occur
T30	Marker 2450 2457	However
R13	Attack Ent1:T29 Ent2:T27	
T31	Claim 2567 2715	It states that the picture described above (intraretinal hemorrhages, without other findings) is characteristic of Purstcher's angiopathy. It is not
R14	Attack Ent1:T31 Ent2:T27	
T32	Claim 2717 2790	In Purstcher's there are hemorrhages, but also cottony exudates and edema
