T18	Claim 730 849	I have decided to rely on the treatment recommended by Harrison, which is the manual that MIR examiners usually rely on
T19	Claim 851 924	This girl presents with hypernatremia due to extrarenal free water losses

R3	Support Ent1:T4 Ent2:T19	
T21	Claim 926 1025	The goal is to replace the lost water and reduce the natremia at a rate of no more than 12 mmol/day
T22	Claim 1027 1097	To calculate fluid therapy, the water deficit must first be calculated
T23	Treatment 1040 1053	fluid therapy
T24	Claim 1205 1295	In this case, the water deficit is: ([[tel:155-140/140|155-140/140]])x60x0.4 = 2.57 liters
T25	Claim 1099 1203	Water def. Water = (Natremia-140/140)xTotal body water. TBW = Weight in kg x 0.4 in females/0.5 in males
T26	Claim 1297 1475	There are only two answers that come close to this figure, but 2 seems more correct, as it is the only one that completely covers the water deficit and uses a hyposodium solution
