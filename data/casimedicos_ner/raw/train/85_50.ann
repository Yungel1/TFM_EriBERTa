T6	Premise 63 170	A patient with a history of febrile illness and chest pain comes to the hospital with dyspnea and tachypnea
T7	Premise 196 221	his blood pressure is low
T8	Premise 223 291	jugular venous pressure is elevated with a deep descending sinus "X"
T9	Premise 296 322	he has a paradoxical pulse
T10	Disease 362 384	Ischemic heart disease
T11	Disease 389 411	Dilated cardiomyopathy
T12	Disease 416 438	Severe aortic stenosis
T13	Disease 443 468	Constrictive pericarditis
T14	Claim 473 516	Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade
T15	Claim 1638 1684	For all these reasons, the correct answer is 5
T16	Claim 1532 1588	In cardiac tamponade, the deep sinus X is characteristic
T17	Premise 612 737	it represents an exaggeration of the physiological phenomenon consisting of inspiratory lowering of BP (normal up to 10 mmHg)
T18	Premise 536 610	Paradoxical pulse is a drop in blood pressure > 10 mmHg during inspiration
T19	Premise 739 1041	In cardiac tamponade, inspiration, which causes an increase in blood flow to the right chambers, increasing their volume, secondarily causes a displacement of the interventricular septum to the left, so that the left heart lodges and expels less blood during systole and the pulse, therefore, decreases
T20	Marker 861 872	secondarily
T21	Marker 780 786	causes
T22	Marker 873 879	causes
T23	Marker 939 941	so
T24	Marker 1021 1030	therefore
T25	Premise 1177 1362	Sinus X represents the systolic collapse of the venous pulse, i.e., the pressure drop due to atrial relaxation (also partly due to a downward displacement of the RV base during systole)
T26	Premise 1364 1530	Sinus Y represents the diastolic collapse of the venous pulse, i.e., the pressure drop that occurs from the moment blood enters the tricuspid valve into the ventricle
T27	Premise 1043 1175	In a normal heart this exaggerated displacement, caused by the pressure exerted by the tamponade on the RV free wall, does not occur
T28	Claim 1590 1636	In constrictive pericarditis, the deep Y sinus
