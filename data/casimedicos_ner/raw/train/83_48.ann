T4	Claim 524 567	Implantation of a ventricular assist device
T5	Claim 572 622	Implantation of a cardiac resynchronization system
T6	Premise 115 407	a 67-year-old patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, left bundle branch block, left ventricular ejection fraction of 26%, mitral insufficiency grade II-III/IV, undergoing treatment with furosemide, spironolactone, enalapril and bisoprolol and who remains in NYHA functional class III
T7	Treatment 412 447	Surgical coronary revascularization
T8	Treatment 452 476	Mitral valve replacement
T9	Treatment 481 519	Implantation of an aortic balloon pump
T10	Treatment 524 567	Implantation of a ventricular assist device
T11	Treatment 572 622	Implantation of a cardiac resynchronization system
T12	Premise 642 848	We are talking about a patient with heart failure with severe LV dysfunction (EF < 35%), LBBB (wide QRS), who is following optimal medical treatment and who remains in advanced functional class despite this
T13	Claim 850 943	Coronary revascularization does not appear to be of much benefit in this patient at this time

R2	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T13	
T14	Claim 945 978	Nor does mitral valve replacement
T15	Claim 980 1071	firstly because mitral regurgitation is most likely the result of mitral annular dilatation
T16	Claim 1077 1204	secondly because we would need an echocardiographic assessment of the mitral valve to determine whether there is any alteration
T17	Marker 980 987	firstly
T18	Marker 988 995	because
T19	Marker 1077 1085	secondly

T21	Claim 1206 1295	Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation implantation would not be indicated in this patient
T22	Claim 1297 1407	it is used in situations of cardiogenic shock, in post-AMI mechanical complications, as a bridge to cardiac Tx

T24	Claim 1488 1578	What would really benefit him of all the answers is number 5, the resynchronization device
R9	Support Ent1:T24 Ent2:T5	
T25	Claim 1580 1701	By achieving simultaneous stimulation of both ventricles, a mechanical synergy is achieved that improves cardiac function
R10	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T24	
T26	Premise 1703 2019	The indications for the application of CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy) are precisely those mentioned at the beginning: severe ventricular dysfunction, asynchrony demonstrated by the presence of wide QRS in the ECG (usually due to LBBB) and advanced functional class (III-IV) despite optimal medical treatment
