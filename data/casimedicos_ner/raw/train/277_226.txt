QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE TRACT
CLINICAL CASE: 
In a colon cancer screening program, a 52-year-old patient undergoes a colonoscopy. The entire colon is normal except for the finding of a 2 cm pedunculated polyp in the sigma which is removed with a diathermy loop. The anatomopathological result indicates that there is a carcinoma in situ limited to the head of the polyp. She has a thoracoabdominal CT scan reported as normal. Indicate the correct course of action.
1- Segmental resection of the affected colon.
2- Periodic endoscopic surveillance.
3- Local resection of the base of the polyp.
4- Sigmoidectomy plus lymphadenectomy.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Carcinoma in situ is delimited by the basement membrane, i.e. it is not invasive yet, and therefore the treatment is polypectomy, which is already done. Subsequently, an endoscopic follow-up (with biopsies) should be performed at an interval of 3 to 6 months depending on the patient's history, age and concomitant pathologies.
