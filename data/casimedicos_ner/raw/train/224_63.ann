T1	Premise 42 131	A 52-year-old patient who has been complaining of dyspnea on medium exertion for 6 months
T2	Premise 133 171	He has not presented angina or syncope
T3	Premise 173 300	Physical examination and diagnostic tests show a mean aortic transvalvular gradient of 55 mmHg and a calculated area of 0.7 cm²
T4	Premise 302 326	Ejection fraction of 65%
T5	Claim 382 435	Diuretics and more frequent check-ups by a specialist
T6	Claim 440 570	In case of increasing dyspnea on exertion, percutaneous dilatation of the aortic valve with a balloon catheter should be performed
T7	Claim 575 638	Replacement of the aortic valve with a prosthesis/bioprosthesis
T8	Claim 643 691	Replacement of the aortic valve with a homograft
T9	Claim 696 732	Implantation of a percutaneous valve
T10	Premise 947 965	And he has dyspnea
T11	Premise 752 768	Something aortic
T12	Premise 770 906	They give me a gradient, which without knowing the values seems somewhat high (55 mmHg!) and the area, which looks tiny to the naked eye
T13	Claim 908 946	this is going to be aortic stenosis...

T14	Disease 928 943	aortic stenosis
T15	Premise 1047 1228	With the guidelines in hand, that's right: this is a severe stenosis both in terms of area (<1 cm²) and mean gradient (>40 mmHg), with a preserved ejection fraction, and symptomatic
T16	Disease 1100 1115	severe stenosis
T17	Claim 1230 1249	Surgical indication
R3	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T17	
T18	Claim 1251 1290	If we do 1 we take away life expectancy
T19	Marker 1292 1299	because

R6	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T6	
T22	Claim 1376 1468	Only if the surgical risk is unaffordable, and in that case we would do 5, TAVI implantation
R7	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T9	
T23	Premise 1480 1575	But this is a 52-year-old man, who we assume has good bodywork because he walks to have dyspnea
R8	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T22	
T24	Marker 1480 1483	But

R10	Attack Ent1:T25 Ent2:T9	
T27	Claim 1771 1928	The correct thing to do is 3, without a doubt: replace with a prosthesis, preferably mechanical unless the patient has a contraindication for anticoagulation
R11	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T7	
T28	Claim 1629 1717	A homograft? That's the Ross technique, I take the pulmonary and put it where the aortic
