QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 58-year-old woman, weight 130 kg, height 155 cm, body mass index > 30 with mild hypertension, blood glucose 108 mg/dL and absence of edema in the lower limbs. Blood analysis showed Cr 2.0 mg/dL, Urea 86 mg/dL, Alb 3.8 g/1, Na 142 mEq/L, K 4 mEq/L. In urinalysis: sediment without alterations and in 24 h urine proteinuria of 6.3 g/24 h. Which of the following entities is more likely to be present?
1- Secondary membranous glomerulonephritis.
2- Focal and segmental glomerulonephritis.
3- IgA nephropathy.
4- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
5- Minimal change nephropathy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The correct answer is: 2. Focal segmental glomerulonephritis. We are in front of a patient with renal insufficiency whose manifestation is a proteinuria. That places us in the picture of nonproliferative GN (membranous, focal and segmental and minimal changes, discarding the other two). If we also consider that the patient was obese, slightly hypertensive, the most probable is that it is a focal segmental glomerulonephritis.
