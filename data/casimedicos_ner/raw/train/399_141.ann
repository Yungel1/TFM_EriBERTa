T1	Premise 60 159	20-year-old male, who consults for lumbosacral pain of inflammatory rhythm of 4 months of evolution
T2	Premise 161 218	Also bilateral thalalgia and morning stiffness for 1 hour
T3	Premise 220 287	In the last 2 months, onset of diarrhea with loss of 4 kg of weight
T4	Claim 338 508	Given the patient's age, he most likely suffers from non-specific low back pain and tendonitis of the feet. If the diarrhea persists, a digestive study would be performed
T5	Claim 513 614	Perform a digestive study to rule out tumor pathology. Low back pain may be due to visceral pathology
T6	Claim 859 1005	The patient presents the clinical features of spondylarthropathy, which is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, as this case suggests
T7	Claim 619 727	The clinical picture is very suggestive of spondyloarthritis. Inflammatory bowel disease should be ruled out
T8	Claim 732 832	I would request a lumbar MRI to rule out disc herniation and if diarrhea persists, a digestive study
