QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 51-year-old man is admitted from the emergency department for macrocytic anemia (Hb 6.3 g/dL, MCV 120 fL). Studies ruled out a deficiency origin. Reticulocytes were 24000/microL. The bone marrow study is compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Cytogenetics shows a 5q deletion. Which is the correct statement regarding this patient?
1- This deletion (5q-) is an alteration of good prognosis and has a specific treatment (lenalidomide).
2- It would be advisable in this patient to perform HLA typing in order to organize an allogeneic transplant.
3- This is a patient with a high International Prognostic Index (IPSS).
4- Treatment in this case would be transfusion only.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
This is a young patient with no comorbidities and is therefore a candidate for treatment with curative intent, so option 4 is ruled out. Option 3 is also incorrect since we cannot know the patient's IPSS since we do not know the number of blasts and the number of leukocytes and platelets to calculate the risk. Option 2 is also incorrect since the indication for a bone marrow transplant in MDS is those patients with high or intermediate-2 IPSS, and in this case we do not know the risk, the only thing we know about the risk is the cytogenetics which is of good prognosis that would give us 0 points. Therefore the correct one is 1 since it is true that it has a favorable cytogenetics (5q-) and has a specific treatment lenalidomide, also used in other pathologies such as multiple myeloma.
