Although this question straddles the line between derma and pediatrics, we would like to do our bit. We are being told about erythema súdenita or fifth disease (also called megaloerythema), caused by parvovirus B19. It is typical that after an episode of high fever an erythema appears on both cheeks in the form of a "slap" that usually has a cranial-caudal extension in the following days.
