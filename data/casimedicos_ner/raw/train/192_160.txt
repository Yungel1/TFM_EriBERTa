QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
The parents of a 5-month-old infant come because their child, who attends day care, has been presenting for 3 days, coinciding with an upper respiratory tract infection, liquid stools numbering 4 per day, occasional alimentary vomiting, and axillary temperature of 38.3°C. He is being fed with mixed breastfeeding. On examination the infant is in good general condition, is well nourished and hydrated and his breathing is eupneic; his weight is 4,730g and has decreased by 70g with respect to the previous week. The abdomen is soft and depressible, without masses or megaliths, and the fontanel is normotensive. Except for the presence of watery rhinorrhea, the rest of the examination by organs and devices is normal. Of the following statements, indicate the answer that you consider CORRECT:
1- An estimation of losses should be made, recommend a 4-hour fast and rehydrate during this time with oral rehydration solution.
2- It is advisable to introduce rice cereals for their astringent effect.
3- A stool culture should be performed as soon as possible to exclude a bacterial origin.
4- The use of lactose-free formula should be recommended.
5- It is advisable to replace losses after each bowel movement with oral rehydration solution and continue with the patient's usual diet.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
The baby is not dehydrated and is in good general condition. Try to avoid dehydration by replenishing what is being lost, avoiding drastic changes in feeding habits as much as possible. The rest of the answers touch on many of the "myths" and customs surrounding gastroenteritis. There is also no evidence of lactose intolerance (perianal irritation, frothy and acid stools, etc.) that would advise lactose-free milk.
