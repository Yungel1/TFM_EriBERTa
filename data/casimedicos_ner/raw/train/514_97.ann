T1	Premise 59 115	After a traffic accident you attend to an injured person
T2	Premise 117 202	The patient opens his eyes at your call, but only utters words that are inappropriate
T3	Premise 204 324	On motor examination, the pain is localized in the right extremities, but spreads on stimulation of the left extremities
T4	Claim 403 409	E3V2M4
T5	Claim 414 420	E3V3M5
T6	Claim 425 431	E2V3M4
T7	Claim 436 442	E2V4M5
T8	Premise 665 889	In this case, we have a patient who has an ocular opening to the call (ocular response 3 out of 4), emits inappropriate words (verbal response 3 out of 5) and localizes pain with right extremities (motor response 5 out of 6)
T9	Claim 736 762	ocular response 3 out of 4

T13	Claim 945 1166	The best value of the examination is taken because in many cases (assessment of a polytraumatized patient, ischemic stroke or spontaneous acute cerebral bleeding), the motor examination may be artifacted by other elements
T14	Claim 1168 1396	For example: in a polytraumatized patient (such as the one in question), the response presented with left extremities may be due to localized trauma in that area, and not strictly speaking to an underlying traumatic brain injury
T15	Claim 1398 1573	Likewise, sometimes the verbal response may be underestimated in the polytraumatized patient due to airway obstruction (e.g., due to the tongue retreating into the oropharynx)

T16	Claim 1575 1669	By always assessing the best response, we will have a truer picture of the patient's condition
