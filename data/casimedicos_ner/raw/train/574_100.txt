QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 80-year-old woman with a history of arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus who suddenly presents with language impairment. On arrival at the hospital, an unknown atrial fibrillation is observed, and on examination she presents fluent speech with a tendency to slurred speech, poor language comprehension, inability to repeat and dysnomia. Semiologically she presents a picture compatible with:
1- Broca's aphasia.
2- Conduction aphasia.
3- Sensitive transcortical aphasia.
4- Wernicke's aphasia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
It is a semiology question that helps us to remember the types of aphasia. The following aspects should be taken into account: language emission (fluent, non-fluent, non-emission), comprehension (yes or no), repetition (yes or no) and nomination. Wernicke's aphasia or sensitive aphasia has a fluent language, does not understand, does not repeat and does not nominate, just like the patient in the question. Sensory transcortical aphasia differs from sensory aphasia in that patients are able to repeat. Conduction aphasia differs from sensory aphasia in that comprehension is preserved, all else being equal. Finally, in broca's aphasia the language is non-fluent, comprehension is preserved, it does not repeat and does not nominate.
