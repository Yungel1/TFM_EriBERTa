QUESTION TYPE: CARDIOLOGY AND VASCULAR SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 26-year-old man with no history of interest, asymptomatic, presents on examination with a mesosystolic murmur in the aortic focus and left parasternal border that increases with the Valsalva maneuver. BP and peripheral pulses are normal and the ECG shows signs of marked left ventricular enlargement and very deep negative T waves in V3, V4, V5 and V6. What is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Functional murmur.
2- Aortic stenosis.
3- Aortic insufficiency.
4- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
5- Ventricular septal defect.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
A young male patient with an aortic systolic murmur that increases with the Valsalva maneuver and signs of left ventricular enlargement is practically a "portrait" of the typical findings that can be found in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Very easy question.
