T1	Premise 45 123	A 34-year-old patient playing tennis is hit by a tennis ball in the left orbit
T2	Premise 125 278	On examination he presents significant palpebral hematoma, hyposphagmia, diplopia to the upper vision with limitation of the upper version of the eyeball
T3	Claim 307 408	Fracture of the inferior wall of the floor of the orbit with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle
T4	Claim 413 436	Zygomatic arch fracture
T5	Claim 441 529	Fracture of the superior wall of the orbit with entrapment of the superior rectus muscle
T6	Claim 534 556	Dentoalveolar fracture
T7	Premise 583 677	The statement describes diplopia to superior vision with limitation of upper eyeball extension
T8	Claim 971 1013	Fracture of the roof is much less frequent
R1	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T5	
T9	Claim 1022 1095	entrapment of the superior rectus would cause limitation for infraduction
R2	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T5	
T10	Claim 679 969	As the mechanical function of the left inferior rectus is compromised, it would not allow to complete the supraduccion movement generating vertical diplopia, this plus the traumatic antecedent allows to suspect a fracture of the orbital floor with muscular entrapment of the inferior rectus
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T3	
T11	Disease 413 436	Zygomatic arch fracture
T12	Disease 307 408	Fracture of the inferior wall of the floor of the orbit with entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle
T13	Disease 441 529	Fracture of the superior wall of the orbit with entrapment of the superior rectus muscle
T14	Disease 534 556	Dentoalveolar fracture
