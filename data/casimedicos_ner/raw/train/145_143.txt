QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 1 month old infant, exclusively breastfed, consults because he has a bowel movement every 5 or 6 days with straining but with a soft consistency, what would our attitude be?
1- Start laxative treatment.
2- Supplement breastfeeding with anti-constipation formula.
3- Start daily rectal stimulation.
4- It is considered normal intestinal rhythm.
5- Refer to Pediatric Digestive to rule out aganglionic megacolon.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
The correct answer is 4. The normal range of stool output in young infants is very wide. To suspect aganglionic megacolon there is usually a delay in the evacuation of meconium and often other associated symptoms such as abdominal distension, difficulty in gaining weight, etc.
