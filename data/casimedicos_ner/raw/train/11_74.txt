QUESTION TYPE: SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
Ten days after performing a hemithyroidectomy on a patient with a 1.5 cm thyroid nodule you receive the following anatomopathologic report: "very cellular follicular pattern without capsular invasion and infiltrating adjacent blood vessels and nerves". Point out the correct answer:
1- As there is no capsular invasion, no further surgery is necessary.
2- Follicular pattern is an indication for prophylactic cervical lymph node emptying.
3- This is a follicular carcinoma and requires completion of thyroidectomy.
4- The report allows us to rule out with total certainty a papillary carcinoma in the remaining thyroid.
5- Measurement of plasma calcitonin will allow us to distinguish between papillary and follicular carcinoma.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
I think the correct answer is 3 answers 2,4 and 5 are clearly false. The doubt is between 1 and 2. The statement of 1 is correct in cases of follicular carcinoma without capsular invasion a total thyroidectomy can be performed. But if there are data of poor prognosis and the possibility of metastases - as in this case - it is best to complete the thyroidectomy and perform a radioactive iodine scan to rule out metastases or treat them if they are present.
