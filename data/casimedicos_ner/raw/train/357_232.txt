CLINICAL CASE:

The examination revealed two lymphadenopathies, one in each groin, 1 cm in diameter, soft, mobile, non-painful. No skin lesions are seen on the lower limbs, anus or perineum. Which test do you consider essential?
1- A lues serology since it is most likely a Treponema pallidum infection.
2- A gynecological examination to rule out ovarian cancer.
3- By the clinical characteristics it seems to be normal lymph nodes and complementary explorations should not be done.
4- A Paul-Bunell test should be performed to rule out infectious mononucleosis.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The presence of inguinal nodes up to 1-1.5cm may be normal in the absence of symptoms. In this case, they are very nonspecific nodes, without signs of malignancy (mobile, soft, not painful) that do not lead us to suspect neoplastic infiltration and the lack of other clinical signs also leads us to rule out the presence of STD.
