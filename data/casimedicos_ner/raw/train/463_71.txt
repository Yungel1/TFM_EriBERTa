QUESTION TYPE: CRITICAL CARE AND EMERGENCY
CLINICAL CASE: 
Woman with hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in whom the following parameters are objectified after insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter: cardiac index 1.4 L/min/m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 25 mmHg and systemic vascular resistances 2000 dynes/m2. The type of shock presented by the patient is:
1- Cardiogenic.
2- Septic.
3- Hypovolemic.
4- Anaphylactic.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
We are not given any further data on the patient except that she is in shock (tissue hypoperfusion) and on introducing a Swan-Ganz catheter we find a low cardiac index (<2), elevated PCP (25mmHg) and elevated systemic resistances (normal: 600-1200 dyne/m2). These data are compatible with cardiogenic origin of shock.
