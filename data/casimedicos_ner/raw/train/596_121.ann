T1	Premise 44 103	79-year-old woman admitted for an osteoporotic hip fracture
T2	Premise 115 158	secondary prevention of fragility fractures
T3	Marker 174 179	WRONG
T4	Claim 191 266	Low adherence to treatment is associated with an increased risk of fracture
T5	Claim 271 354	Bone remodeling markers may be useful for early monitoring of response to treatment
T6	Claim 359 453	Vitamin D monotherapy is effective in reducing such fractures in non-institutionalized elderly
T7	Claim 458 573	Increasing dietary calcium or taking calcium supplements alone does not protect against the occurrence of fractures
T8	Claim 600 656	This question corresponds to the section on traumatology
T9	Claim 658 799	however, it could be answered with knowledge of rheumatology and with the osteoporosis recommendations of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology
T10	Marker 658 665	however
T11	Claim 801 909	In osteoporosis, one of the main risks associated with increased fracture risk is low adherence to treatment
T12	Claim 914 934	answer 1 is correct.
T13	Marker 911 913	so
R1	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T12	
R2	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T4	
R3	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T4	
T14	Claim 935 1119	Answer 2 is found in the SER guidelines, which confirm that some studies conclude that bone remodeling markers can be useful for early monitoring of adherence and response to treatment
R4	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T5	
T15	Claim 1121 1140	Answer 4 is correct
T16	Marker 1141 1148	because
T17	Claim 1149 1369	again in the SER 2019 guidelines they quote: "The current scientific evidence allows us to affirm that neither increasing dietary calcium nor taking calcium supplements alone protects against the appearance of fractures"
R5	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T15	
R6	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T7	
T18	Claim 1371 1429	Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option 3
T19	Marker 1371 1380	Therefore
R7	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T6	
T20	Claim 1431 1713	Patients on pharmacological treatment for OP should use calcium and vitamin D supplements because practically all clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy of antiosteoporotic drugs routinely include calcium supplements and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), but not in monotherapy
R8	Attack Ent1:T20 Ent2:T6	
T21	Marker 1521 1528	because
T22	Marker 1691 1694	but
