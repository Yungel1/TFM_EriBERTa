QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
In a 3-month-old infant all the clinical manifestations outlined below would make it necessary to rule out cystic fibrosis, EXCEPT:
1- Delayed meconium evacuation.
2- Salty taste of the skin.
3- Isolation of secretions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
4- Deterioration/detention of the weight curve.
5- Hypernatremic dehydration.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
Dehydration may be due to diarrhea of other etiologies. I have doubts about answer 3 since it does not specify which secretions are involved. We have to understand that the growth of Pseudomona aeruginosa is in the culture of bronchial secretions. Because clearly the indication to perform a sweat chlorine (to rule out FQP) are the HIPOnatremic dehydrations and not the hypernatremic ones as the answer says.
