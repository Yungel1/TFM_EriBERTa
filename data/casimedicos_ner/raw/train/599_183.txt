QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 45-year-old woman with no history of interest consults for dyspneic sensation of about 4 days of evolution. Examination shows rhythmic tachycardia, without murmurs and pulmonary auscultation is normal. Arterial blood gases showed a pO2 of 70 mmHg and a pCO2 of 32 mmHg. Hemogram, renal and hepatic function are normal. Prothrombin time 90%, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of 2 to control (N <1.2). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Antiphospholipid syndrome.
2- Factor V of Leiden.
3- Hemophilia.
4- Acute pericarditis.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
In this clinical case, we are presented with a woman who rapidly presents dyspnea with hypoxemia, a picture compatible with pulmonary thromboembolism. The prothrombin time of 90% and the aPTT with a ratio of 2, is translating a coagulation problem; and antiphospholipid antibodies can be detected through the prolongation of phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests, correct answer 1. On the other hand, although factor V Leiden has been identified as a common cause of familial thrombosis, it would not alter the clotting time. In the case of hemophilia there would be a problem in blood coagulation but it is not a frequent cause of thromboembolism. Finally, although acute pericarditis could manifest itself in 4 days and with tachycardia, the rest of the symptoms or analytical parameters are not characteristic.
