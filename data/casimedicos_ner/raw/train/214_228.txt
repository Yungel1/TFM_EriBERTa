QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 19-year-old man consults for a 24-hour history of pain, swelling and functional impotence of the right knee accompanied by a fever of 38°C. Physical examination reveals inflammatory signs and joint effusion in the right knee. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated C-reactive protein. The syndromic diagnosis of acute monoarthritis is made. What is the most likely etiologic diagnosis?
1- Arthritis due to microcrystals.
2- Reactive arthritis.
3- Bacterial infectious arthritis.
4- Mycobacterial infectious arthritis.
5- Rheumatoid arthritis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Acute monoarthritis associated with fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and increased acute phase reactants does not always have a septic origin. In the absence of further information (more complete anamnesis on the current disease, risk factors, personal and family history, extra-articular symptoms or signs, etc.) it can be said that also 1 and 2 (and very exceptionally 5) could debut with a similar clinical and biological picture. With the data provided and taking into account that this is a young male, the most likely option would be bacterial infectious arthritis (that caused by mycobacteria usually have a chronic course). And above all, because of its implications, the first one to always rule out.
