T1	Premise 42 149	A 51-year-old man is admitted from the emergency department for macrocytic anemia (Hb 6.3 g/dL, MCV 120 fL)
T2	Premise 151 188	Studies ruled out a deficiency origin
T3	Marker 159 168	ruled out
T4	Premise 190 221	Reticulocytes were 24000/microL
T5	Premise 223 294	The bone marrow study is compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
T6	Premise 296 328	Cytogenetics shows a 5q deletion
T7	Claim 388 486	This deletion (5q-) is an alteration of good prognosis and has a specific treatment (lenalidomide)
T8	Claim 491 596	It would be advisable in this patient to perform HLA typing in order to organize an allogeneic transplant
T9	Claim 601 668	This is a patient with a high International Prognostic Index (IPSS)
T10	Claim 673 721	Treatment in this case would be transfusion only
T11	Premise 748 793	This is a young patient with no comorbidities
T12	Claim 798 857	is therefore a candidate for treatment with curative intent
T13	Marker 801 810	therefore
T14	Marker 859 861	so
T15	Claim 862 883	option 4 is ruled out
T16	Marker 874 883	ruled out
T17	Claim 885 911	Option 3 is also incorrect

R2	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T15	
R3	Attack Ent1:T15 Ent2:T10	
T18	Treatment 705 716	transfusion
T19	Claim 918 951	we cannot know the patient's IPSS
T20	Premise 958 1058	we do not know the number of blasts and the number of leukocytes and platelets to calculate the risk
T21	Marker 952 957	since
T22	Marker 912 917	since
R4	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T17	
R5	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T19

T23	Claim 1060 1086	Option 2 is also incorrect
T24	Marker 1087 1092	since
T25	Claim 1093 1194	the indication for a bone marrow transplant in MDS is those patients with high or intermediate-2 IPSS
T26	Premise 1200 1350	in this case we do not know the risk, the only thing we know about the risk is the cytogenetics which is of good prognosis that would give us 0 points

T28	Marker 1383 1388	since
T29	Claim 1389 1541	it is true that it has a favorable cytogenetics (5q-) and has a specific treatment lenalidomide, also used in other pathologies such as multiple myeloma
R11	Support Ent1:T29 Ent2:T27	
T30	Treatment 1472 1484	lenalidomide
T31	Disease 1525 1541	multiple myeloma
T32	Treatment 473 485	lenalidomide
T33	Diagnostics 540 550	HLA typing
