T1	Premise 55 132	Amalia is a 3-year-old girl who has undergone surgery for tetralogy of Fallot
T2	Premise 134 264	She also presented thymic dysfunction in the neonatal period and hypocalcemia as well as a nasal voice and psychomotor retardation
T3	Claim 356 419	22q11 deletion study (Di George or Velo-cardio-facial syndrome)
T4	Claim 424 488	Study of FMR1 gene expansion, responsible for Fragile X syndrome
T5	Claim 493 546	Sequencing of genes related to HRAS (Noonan syndrome)
T6	Claim 551 592	Genetic study of Williams Beuren syndrome
T7	Premise 619 911	Question in which the clinical picture must be recognized: cardiovascular anomalies - Tetralogy of Fallot -; thymic aplasia/hypoplasia - leading to primary T-cell immunodeficiency; parathyroid aplasia/hypoplasia - hence hypocalcemia -; palatal anomalies - nasal voice; psychomotor retardation
T8	Claim 913 1049	In my opinion, just with the words "thymic dysfunction", hypocalcemia and cardiopathy, we would have to go straight to DiGeorge syndrome
T9	Claim 1051 1180	Indeed, the genetic defect is a 22q11.2 deletion (which if we know it, the better, but with the clinic it would be enough for us)
T10	Marker 1134 1137	but
R1	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T8	
R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T3	
R3	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T3	
T11	Claim 1182 1295	The only option with which there could be doubt is Noonan syndrome, which can also be associated with cardiopathy
T12	Claim 1297 1381	but above all it is characterized by short stature, cardiopathy and bone alterations
T13	Claim 1383 1495	moreover, in most cases it is caused by an alteration in the PTPN11 gene, not in those mentioned in the question
R4	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T5	
R5	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T11	
T14	Marker 1297 1300	but
T15	Marker 1301 1310	above all
R6	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T11	
T16	Marker 1383 1391	moreover
