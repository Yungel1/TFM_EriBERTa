QUESTION TYPE: DERMATOLOGY, VENEREOLOGY AND PLASTIC SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 60-year-old male patient who reported 10 days ago the appearance of blistering lesions on the dorsum of the hands after sun exposure. The picture is accompanied by skin fragility. Histopathologically there is a subepidermal blister with PAS+ deposits in and around the superficial dermal vessels. The most plausible diagnosis is:
1- Familial benign pemphigus.
2- Pemphigoid.
3- Porphyria cutanea tarda.
4- Pemphigus vulgaris.
5- Scalded skin syndrome.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The fact of being a photoinduced picture, the histology and the age make the diagnosis of PCT more probable (3). The rest of the answers do not fit with the clinical picture or the histology.
