T1	Premise 41 154	We are referred from ophthalmology to a 31-year-old man who consulted for loss of vision and progressive headache
T2	Premise 156 298	Physical examination showed temporal hemianopsia and pituitary MRI showed a 35 x 30 x 20 mm turnoration compressing chiasm and cavernous sinus
T3	Premise 300 515	The results of the functional study are cortisol 14 microg/dL, TSH 1.4 microU/ml, T4L 1.2 ng/dL, prolactin 480 microg/L (vn < 15), testosterone 160 ng/dL (vn 300-1200), FSH 1.2 U/I., (vn 5-15) and LH 2 U/L (vn 3-15)
T4	Claim 562 583	Dopaminergic agonists
T5	Claim 588 611	Transsphenoidal surgery
T6	Claim 616 653	External radiotherapy or radiosurgery
T7	Claim 658 718	Treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with testosterone
T8	Claim 745 793	From what is described it is a macroprolactinoma
T9	Marker 794 796	as
T10	Premise 797 934	it is a pituitary tumor of more than one centimeter, which secretes prolactin and with an insufficiency of the rest of pituitary hormones
R1	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T8	
T11	Disease 776 793	macroprolactinoma
T12	Claim 936 995	The first line treatment of choice is dopaminergic agonists
T13	Treatment 974 995	dopaminergic agonists
R2	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T4	
T14	Claim 997 1062	although when the visual field is affected, surgery may be chosen
T15	Marker 997 1005	although
T16	Claim 1127 1154	the surgical risk increases
T17	Marker 1064 1076	In this case
T18	Marker 1124 1126	so
R3	Attack Ent1:T16 Ent2:T5	
T19	Premise 1064 1122	In this case, the cavernous sinus is pressured by the mass
R4	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T16	
R5	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T5	
T20	Claim 1156 1228	Therefore, in this particular case, the surgical option seems more risky
T21	Marker 1156 1165	Therefore
R6	Attack Ent1:T20 Ent2:T5	
T22	Claim 1230 1481	Taking this into account and the fact that it is a tumor that produces high levels of prolactin, which indicates that it probably responds to pharmacological blockade, the most appropriate option would be option 1, treatment with dopaminergic agonists
R7	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T4	
T23	Treatment 1460 1481	dopaminergic agonists
T24	Treatment 562 583	Dopaminergic agonists
T25	Treatment 588 611	Transsphenoidal surgery
T26	Treatment 616 653	External radiotherapy or radiosurgery
T27	Treatment 658 718	Treatment of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with testosterone
R8	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T20
