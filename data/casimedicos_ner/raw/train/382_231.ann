T3	Claim 433 583	Perform a cranial CT scan and if there are no hemorrhagic lesions or other contraindications in the analysis, start immediate intravenous thrombolysis
T4	Claim 588 669	Perform urgent cranial CT scan and if there is no bleeding, start anticoagulation
T5	Claim 674 836	Perform cranial CT scan and admission to rehabilitation center, since their attitude will not differ regardless of whether the etiology is ischemic or hemorrhagic
