QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A patient undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia is admitted for pneumonia for which treatment with cefepime has been prescribed. A chest X-ray/CT scan shows an infiltrate with halo sign and crescentic meniscus. The lesion is peripheral and a transthoracic puncture is indicated for sampling. Pending definitive histologic and microbiologic results, what antimicrobial would you add to the treatment?
1- Ganciclovir.
2- Caspofungin.
3- Fluconazole.
4- Piperacillin-tazobactam.
5- Voriconazole.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
Direct response question. This is a patient undergoing chemotherapy with respiratory symptoms and the "halo sign" on X-ray, very suggestive of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Treatment is with voriconazole. Aspergillus is resistant to fluconazole, so it would not be a valid option.
