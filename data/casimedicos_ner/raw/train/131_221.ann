T1	Premise 58 363	An individual presents with "muscle weakness" (spastic hemiparesis) of both right extremities, with hyperreflexia and Babinski's sign, along with a "facial flaccid paralysis" of the left hemiface, with inability to close the left eye or retract the left side of the mouth, in addition to other alterations
T2	Disease 104 124	(spastic hemiparesis
T3	Premise 365 501	From the data described, it is an alteration that affects, among other elements, the motor fascicles: cortico-spinal and cortico-nuclear
T4	Claim 570 649	At the level of the area 4 of Brodmann of the cerebral cortex of the right side
T5	Claim 654 710	In the internal capsule, posterior arm on the right side
T6	Claim 715 744	In the left cerebral peduncle
T7	Claim 749 814	In the medial portion of the caudal protuberance of the left side
T8	Claim 819 899	In the medulla oblongata before decussation of the right cortico-spinal fascicle
T10	Marker 1031 1036	since
T9	Premise 959 1079	We have a right hemiparesis and involvement of the left facial nucleus, since it has affected the upper and lower facial
T11	Claim 1081 1170	therefore we have a crossed clinical picture, having to think about brainstem involvement
T12	Marker 1081 1090	therefore

T13	Claim 1172 1385	If we have in a quick diagram where the nuclei of the cranial pairs start from: the first 4 above the pons, the next 4 in the pons, and the last 4 below the pons, we have that the facial nucleus is in the middle 4
T14	Claim 1387 1439	That is, left facial nucleus, left pons, so answer 4
T15	Marker 1428 1430	so
