QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
79-year-old woman admitted for an osteoporotic hip fracture. Regarding secondary prevention of fragility fractures, point out the WRONG answer:
1- Low adherence to treatment is associated with an increased risk of fracture.
2- Bone remodeling markers may be useful for early monitoring of response to treatment.
3- Vitamin D monotherapy is effective in reducing such fractures in non-institutionalized elderly.
4- Increasing dietary calcium or taking calcium supplements alone does not protect against the occurrence of fractures.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
This question corresponds to the section on traumatology; however, it could be answered with knowledge of rheumatology and with the osteoporosis recommendations of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology. In osteoporosis, one of the main risks associated with increased fracture risk is low adherence to treatment, so answer 1 is correct. Answer 2 is found in the SER guidelines, which confirm that some studies conclude that bone remodeling markers can be useful for early monitoring of adherence and response to treatment. Answer 4 is correct because again in the SER 2019 guidelines they quote: "The current scientific evidence allows us to affirm that neither increasing dietary calcium nor taking calcium supplements alone protects against the appearance of fractures". Therefore, the correct answer to this question is option 3. Patients on pharmacological treatment for OP should use calcium and vitamin D supplements because practically all clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy of antiosteoporotic drugs routinely include calcium supplements and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), but not in monotherapy.
