T1	Premise 45 163	An 84-year-old woman presents with loss of vision in the left eye of 4 days of evolution accompanied by metamorphopsia
T2	Premise 165 280	The macula shows abundant hard exudates, two small deep hemorrhages and a localized neurosensory retinal detachment
T3	Premise 282 337	In the contralateral eye there are abundant soft drusen
T4	Claim 428 463	Acute posterior vitreous detachment
T5	Claim 468 516	Exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
T6	Claim 521 555	Central retinal artery obstruction
T7	Claim 560 608	Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
T8	Claim 748 786	The description is typical of option 2
R1	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T5	
T9	Premise 941 1027	In any case, we have an elderly patient with vision loss and metamorphopsia in one eye
T10	Claim 788 810	It is an exudative AMD
T11	Claim 812 938	although as we said in question 215, with the new classification, we would speak of an advanced AMD in its neovascular variant
T12	Premise 1029 1079	In the examination there are lesions in the macula
T13	Claim 1081 1225	With that we can rule out acute posterior vitreous detachment, which does not produce visual loss, nor metamorphopsia, nor lesions in the macula
T14	Marker 812 820	although
R2	Attack Ent1:T11 Ent2:T10	
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T5	
T15	Marker 1098 1106	rule out
T16	Disease 1107 1142	acute posterior vitreous detachment
R4	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T13	
R5	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T13	
R6	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T4	
T17	Claim 1227 1284	And also non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
T18	Marker 1286 1293	because
T19	Claim 1294 1393	although it produces visual loss and is typical of older people, it does not produce metamorphopsia
R7	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T17	
R8	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T7	
T20	Claim 1395 1451	And there are no lesions in the macula but papilla edema
R9	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T17	
T21	Claim 1453 1623	In central retinal artery obstruction, metamorphopsia is not particularly characteristic (visual loss and advanced age are), but the lesions in the fundus of the eye vary
R10	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T21	
T22	Claim 1625 1754	In the case of arterial occlusion, there is intracellular edema that is seen as absence of hemorrhages and a whitish, pale fundus
R11	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T6	
T23	Claim 1756 1855	In addition, the entire retina is globally affected, and a cherry-red spot may appear in the macula
T24	Claim 1857 1903	In this case the lesions are totally different
T25	Premise 1905 1996	They describe hard exudates, deep hemorrhages and localized neurosensory retinal detachment
T26	Premise 1998 2020	All this in the macula
T27	Claim 2022 2093	These are the characteristic findings of neovascular (or exudative) AMD
R12	Attack Ent1:T24 Ent2:T6	
R13	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T6	
R14	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T6	
R15	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T27	
R16	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T27	
T28	Premise 2095 2153	As a clue, in the other eye there are abundant soft drusen
R17	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T27	
T29	Claim 2155 2193	Drusen are the typical findings of AMD
R18	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T29	
R19	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T4	
R20	Support Ent1:T29 Ent2:T4	
T30	Claim 2195 2317	So he has AMD in both eyes and in the right eye it has recently become complicated by the appearance of neovascularization
T31	Marker 2195 2197	So
R21	Support Ent1:T30 Ent2:T4	
T32	Disease 428 463	Acute posterior vitreous detachment
T33	Disease 468 516	Exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
T34	Disease 521 555	Central retinal artery obstruction
T35	Disease 560 608	Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
