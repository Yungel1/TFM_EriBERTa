T1	Premise 41 123	An 80-year-old man is admitted for a sudden onset of aphasia and right hemiparesis
T2	Premise 125 261	His history includes hypertension, well controlled with diet and cognitive deterioration in the last year under study by his neurologist
T3	Premise 263 352	The emergency cranial CT scan shows a left frontal lobar hematoma without contrast uptake
T4	Claim 406 457	Arteriovenous malformation masked by acute hematoma
T5	Claim 462 491	Chronic arterial hypertension
T6	Claim 496 537	Isolated vasculitis of the nervous system
T7	Claim 542 553	Brain tumor
T8	Claim 558 610	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (congophilic angiopathy)
T9	Claim 630 787	Amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of spontaneous non-hypertensive hemorrhage in elderly patients, and is usually lobar in location (as in the case)
R1	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T9	
T10	Disease 630 648	Amyloid angiopathy
T11	Disease 677 716	spontaneous non-hypertensive hemorrhage
R2	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T8	
T12	Claim 861 923	The response that may cause the most doubts is 2, hypertension
T13	Marker 925 928	but
T14	Claim 929 1004	the most frequent localizations are: putamen, thalamus, pons and cerebellum
R3	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T12	
R4	Attack Ent1:T3 Ent2:T14	
T15	Claim 1006 1073	Therefore, most of the time these are deep hemorrhages (CTO Manual)
T16	Claim 789 859	They often appear in association with Alzheimer's disease (CTO Manual)
T17	Marker 1006 1015	Therefore
T18	Premise 1075 1173	In addition, as a clue it tells us that the patient has well-controlled hypertension without drugs
T19	Claim 1175 1234	although this data would not serve to rule out the response
T20	Marker 1175 1183	although
T21	Marker 1213 1221	rule out
R5	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T12	
R6	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T19	
T22	Claim 1236 1311	Answer 1, a malformation is typical of young patients, rare in older people
R7	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T22	
R8	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T4	
T23	Claim 1399 1444	Answer 4, a brain tumor, does not seem likely
T24	Marker 1445 1450	since
T25	Premise 1451 1477	the mass is not seen on CT
R9	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T23	
R10	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T7	
R11	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T5	
T26	Claim 1508 1584	it is more difficult not to find such a lesion after contrast administration
R12	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T23	
T27	Claim 1586 1678	Answer 3 does not seem correct since vasculitis is a rare entity and more so in older people
R13	Attack Ent1:T27 Ent2:T6	
T28	Marker 1617 1622	since
T29	Disease 406 457	Arteriovenous malformation masked by acute hematoma
T30	Disease 462 491	Chronic arterial hypertension
T31	Disease 496 537	Isolated vasculitis of the nervous system
T32	Disease 542 553	Brain tumor
T33	Disease 558 610	Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (congophilic angiopathy)
