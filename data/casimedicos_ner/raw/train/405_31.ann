T1	Premise 50 185	A 20-year-old woman with a 15-cm solid-cystic ovarian tumor detected by ultrasound after presenting with nonspecific abdominal symptoms
T2	Premise 187 459	In the histopathological study of the corresponding specimen, teeth, hairs, areas of intestinal epithelium, areas of squamous epithelium (15%) and bronchial epithelium, as well as neuroectodermal and embryonic elements are found in several of the histological preparations
T3	Claim 524 539	Teratocarcinoma
T4	Claim 544 561	Immature teratoma
T5	Claim 566 588	Mature cystic teratoma
T6	Claim 593 605	Dysgerminoma
T7	Claim 632 676	Teratoma is the most frequent germinal tumor
T8	Claim 678 780	It presents differentiation in elements of the three embryonic layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm
T9	Claim 782 970	Macroscopically they can be cystic or solid, and histologically the tissues composing the tumor can be mature (well differentiated, like adult tissues) or immature (like embryonic tissues)
T10	Claim 971 1098	Mature cystic teratoma is the most frequent: they represent on average 10% of ovarian tumors (5-25% depending on the casuistry)
T11	Claim 1100 1121	They occur at any age
T12	Claim 1123 1214	They predominate in ectodermal tissues, such as skin, lining a cavity of keratinous content
T13	Claim 1216 1298	In the cavity a spur is recognized from which hair or tooth structures often arise
T14	Claim 1300 1451	Frequent tissues include: nervous tissue, usually glial and ependymal epithelium, respiratory and digestive epithelia and various mesodermal structures
T15	Claim 1453 1493	They are bilateral in about 10% of cases
T16	Claim 1495 1702	The mature cystic teratoma is benign, but in 2% of them a malignant tumor may develop from one of the tissue components (spinocellular carcinoma, carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, thyroid tissue carcinoma, sarcoma)
T17	Claim 1704 1779	In this case at first we thought that the option was mature cystic teratoma
T18	Premise 1780 1936	but thanks to Ramón, when we read it more carefully, we found that it had neuroectodermal and embryonal elements in several of the histological preparations
T19	Claim 1938 1981	so we consider that the correct answer is 2
T20	Marker 1938 1940	so
R1	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T19	
R2	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T4
