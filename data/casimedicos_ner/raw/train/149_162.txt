QUESTION TYPE: PSYCHIATRY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 52-year-old woman comes to the emergency room with bilateral paralysis of the upper extremities that had started abruptly two hours earlier. In the interview she is smiling and says she does not understand why her family is so worried. The family refers that the day before her son had been arrested by the police for drug trafficking and they had not yet been able to contact him. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Factitious disorder.
2- Delusional disorder.
3- Hypochondriasis.
4- Major depressive disorder.
5- Conversive disorder.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
The nice word to describe this is: "Belle indeference", this woman shows herself with an elegant indifference to a paralysis. The diagnosis.... can be excluded 2,3,4 because the clinical does not match: no delirium, no worry, no sadness. 1 would be if he was making a profit, if he was knowingly simulating and to make a profit he was faking his illness. This is not the case. Conversive would be if the symptom wanted to transmit something to us, that is to say, it was a metaphor of its internal world... The most exact in this case: 5.
