QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 30-year-old woman, asymptomatic, is found to be anemic on routine examination. Physical examination reveals conjunctival jaundice and splenomegaly. The patient refers to a family history of biliary lithiasis at an early age. All this suggests the most probable diagnosis of:
1- Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
2- Thalassemia minor.
3- Vitamin Bl2 and/or folic acid deficiency.
4- Familial pyruvate kinase deficiency.
5- Hereditary spherocytosis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
You have probably looked at answer 5, hereditary spherocytosis, associated with biliary lithiasis at an early age. Exactly, that is the correct one. In the statement they have not stopped giving clues: conjunctival jaundice, splenomegaly and family history of biliary lithiasis at an early age. He has reached 30 years of age without suffering a hemolytic crisis, without suffering any symptoms. There was no mention of microcytosis or macrocytosis to suggest thalassemia minor or B12 and/or folic acid deficiency. Nor of hemolytic crisis associated with the consumption of drugs, infections or ingestion of beans or peas. They have not given any clues to stop to think about other possibilities.
