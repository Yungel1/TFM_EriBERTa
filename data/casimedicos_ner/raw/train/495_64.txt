QUESTION TYPE: MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
65-year-old woman with no comorbidities, undergoing left breast-conserving surgery with selective sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological anatomy of the specimen shows an infiltrating ductal carcinoma grade III of 11 mm, two negative sentinel nodes, estrogen receptors: 0%, progesterone receptors: 0%, Ki 67: 70%, HER2: negative. The extension study is negative. Adjuvant treatment would be:
1- Chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and taxanes, radiotherapy and trastuzumab.
2- Chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and taxanes, radiotherapy and tamoxifen.
3- Chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and taxanes, and radiotherapy.
4- Chemotherapy based on anthracyclines and taxanes, radiotherapy and aromatase inhibitors, since it is postmenopausal.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Typical question, conservative surgery implies radiate, for sure. High grade, and no hormone receptors or her2 (the dreaded triple negative). I was there when there were no taxanes or herceptin and I was in the trials that showed that more and more are being cured, unfortunately still not all. That is why today, anthracyclines (does not suffer from heart) and taxanes before RT. My specialty is beautiful, and will be more so in the coming years.
