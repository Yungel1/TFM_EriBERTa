QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A patient's arterial blood gas result is: pH: 7.40, PaCO2 60 mmHg; bicarbonate 36 mM/L. What is the presenting disturbance:
1- None, pH is normal.
2- Respiratory acidosis.
3- Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
4- Metabolic alkalosis.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Blood gases can be misleading since a normal pH may suggest that there is no disturbance of acid-base balance, instead it is masking a double disturbance in opposite directions as in this case. The patient presents with respiratory acidosis (PaCO2 60 mmHg; normal to 50) and compensatory metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate 36 mmol/l; normal to 28). This is the typical blood gas of the patient with COPD and compensated chronic respiratory failure.
