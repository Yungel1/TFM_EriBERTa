QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 25-year-old patient, during a tennis match, has intense pain in the neck and in the left eye. The next morning he wakes up with a feeling of gait instability and has palpebral ptosis of the left eye and anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right. The patient maintains good visual acuity. Where would you most likely locate the lesion?
1- III cranial pair.
2- Optic chiasm.
3- Superior cervical ganglion.
4- Spinal bulb.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
The picture presented to us is that of a Horner syndrome (miosis with ptosis) so the possibilities are reduced to options 3 or 4, but they specify that the patient presents gait instability, which is not justified by a Horner due to carotid dissection affecting the superior cervical ganglion, which is what they want us to believe when they talk about pain in the neck and in the eye. If the patient really has ataxia, the only possible location would be the spinal cord.
