T3	Premise 287 317	She denies alcohol consumption
T4	Premise 319 419	She does not take any medication except occasional ibuprofen for muscle pain after sports activities
T5	Premise 421 489	The CBC shows increased bilirubin at the expense of direct bilirubin
T6	Premise 491 632	An urgent ultrasound shows a normal liver, vesicular cholesterosis and absence of bile duct dilatation, with no other alterations of interest
T7	Claim 672 708	Acute cholangitis due to biliary mud
T8	Claim 713 745	Toxic hepatitis due to ibuprofen
T9	Claim 750 768	Cholangiocarcinoma
T10	Claim 773 791	Gilbert's syndrome
T11	Claim 870 989	Ibuprofen hepatitis is a rare adverse effect with a prevalence of about 3.7/100,000 users and 1.1/100,000 prescriptions
T12	Claim 991 1096	It appears that it may be related to dose and duration of treatment, but there is little evidence on this
T13	Marker 1060 1063	but
T14	Claim 1098 1164	Among the NSAIDs with the highest risk are diclofenac and sulindac
T15	Claim 1166 1276	In terms of frequency, the prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma is 2/100,000 patients, a very comparable frequency
T16	Claim 1278 1447	The absence of bile duct dilatation in cholangiocarcinomas can be seen in cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas or in those with mixed histology with hepatocarcinoma
T17	Claim 1449 1610	It is true that the acute course and the absence of constitutional syndrome may make us think against this option and tip the balance towards ibuprofen hepatitis
