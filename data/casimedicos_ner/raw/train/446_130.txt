CLINICAL CASE: 
A 28-year-old man comes to the hospital emergency room with gross hematuria. Which of the following urinalysis abnormalities would support a diagnosis of glomerulonephritis?
1- Dysmorphic red blood cells and/or hematic casts.
2- Proteinuria of 1 g/day, with negative test strip result and with microalbuminuria greater than 300 mg/24 hours.
3- Coexistence of hematuria with pyuria without bacteriuria.
4- Clots in the urine with the naked eye.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Glomerulonephritis is typically associated with dysmorphic red blood cells and hematic casts in the sediment (option 1 correct). Proteinuria can also appear in variable range, although it is not usual in the form of isolated microalbuminuria (incorrect option 2), and hematuria with pyuria although it is not characteristic (incorrect option 3). Clots usually appear in the context of alterations of the lower urinary tract (option 4 incorrect).
