T1	Premise 45 272	a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate, prednisone and indomethacin who acutely presents edema and increased plasma creatinine with a poorly expressive urine sediment and proteinuria less than 100 mg/24 h
T2	Claim 302 319	Renal amyloidosis
T3	Claim 324 376	Glomerulonephritis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis
T4	Claim 381 439	Renal failure due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
T5	Claim 444 486	Interstitial nephritis due to methotrexate
T6	Claim 513 600	Prerenal acute renal failure due to NSAIDs seems the most plausible option in this case
R1	Support Ent1:T6 Ent2:T4	
T7	Claim 602 715	Tubulointerstitial nephritis due to methotrexate is less likely due to the absence of rash, fever or eosinophilia

T11	Claim 764 828	Although GMN and renal amyloidosis are relatively frequent in RA
T12	Claim 830 915	the anodyne urine sediment and the absence of proteinuria make these options unlikely
