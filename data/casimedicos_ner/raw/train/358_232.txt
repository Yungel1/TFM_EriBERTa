QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 24-year-old woman consults after noticing inguinal lymphadenopathies. The interrogation does not show any local discomfort or data suggestive of sexually transmitted infection. The examination revealed two lymphadenopathies, one in each groin, 1 cm in diameter, soft, mobile, non-painful. No skin lesions are seen on the lower limbs, anus or perineum. Which test do you consider essential?
1- A lupus serology since it is most likely a Treponema pallidum infection.
2- A gynecological examination to rule out ovarian cancer.
3- From the clinical features it seems to be normal lymph nodes and complementary explorations should not be performed.
4- A Paul-Bunell test should be performed to rule out infectious mononucleosis.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The correct answer is 3. In the inguinal region, the lymph nodes can acquire a size of up to 1.5 cm being normal. In addition, the rest of the data of the inguinal exploration (no pain, mobile, soft, etc.) corroborates this. On the other hand, there are no signs or symptoms that make us think of a sexually transmitted infection.
