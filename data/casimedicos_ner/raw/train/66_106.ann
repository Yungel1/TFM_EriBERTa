T17	Claim 473 532	The presenting acid-base disorder is a respiratory acidosis
T18	Claim 537 587	Compensation to correct the acidosis is inadequate
T19	Claim 592 649	With this exploration, we rule out that she is dehydrated
T20	Claim 654 696	In any case, we should not put bicarbonate

T26	Marker 1489 1491	so
T27	Claim 1492 1614	it is most likely that their renal failure (although they do not give us urine ion data to confirm it) is of prerenal type
T28	Claim 1616 1672	The treatment would be water and electrolyte replacement

T38	Claim 844 1201	Severe metabolic acidosis causes myocardial contractile depression, reduced effectiveness of catecholamines, increased incidence of arrhythmias, vasodilatation and increased capillary permeability, with the consequent reduction of tissue flow, at the cerebral level (leading to states of confusion and even coma), at the renal level, at the hepatic level...
