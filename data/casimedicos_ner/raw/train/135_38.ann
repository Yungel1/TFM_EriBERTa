T4	Diagnostics 167 187	screening ultrasound
T5	Diagnostics 219 243	thoracoabdominal CT scan
T6	Premise 245 434	This scan showed the presence of 4 liver lesions (one of them up to 6 cm) with uptake pattern typical of hepatocarcinoma, tumor vascular invasion and a metastasis in the right adrenal gland
T7	Diagnostics 245 254	This scan
T8	Disease 350 365	hepatocarcinoma
T9	Premise 436 458	No ascites is observed
T10	Premise 460 518	The patient reports only asthenia, but no general syndrome
T11	Marker 495 498	but
T12	Claim 563 685	Symptomatic and supportive treatment, since he presented an advanced hepatocarcinoma with vascular invasion and metastasis
T13	Marker 601 606	since
T14	Claim 690 810	Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), since the treatment increases survival in patients with advanced hepatocarcinoma
T15	Disease 632 647	hepatocarcinoma
T16	Disease 795 810	hepatocarcinoma
T17	Treatment 690 728	Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)

T19	Claim 815 931	Systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin iv since he presents disseminated disease but he is in good general condition
T20	Marker 857 862	since
T21	Treatment 815 856	Systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin iv
T22	Marker 896 899	but

T31	Disease 1233 1242	cirrhosis
T32	Claim 1271 1483	The patient presents a good general condition with a recently diagnosed hepatocarcinoma, not giving him any type of treatment other than symptomatic and supportive at this stage would not be the right thing to do
T33	Disease 1343 1358	hepatocarcinoma
R1	Attack Ent1:T32 Ent2:T12	
T34	Claim 1485 1548	TACE would not be indicated because of extrahepatic involvement
