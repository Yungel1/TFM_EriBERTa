2- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy without surgery, followed by radiotherapy.
3- Surgery followed by combined chemoradiotherapy.

CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Typical smoker's pancoast, probably an epidermoid, with Horner's sdr. Best would be chemoradio followed by surgical salvage. In the old days it was just RT and surgery. Maybe not far off enter immunotherapy in first line. There are more and more new things.
