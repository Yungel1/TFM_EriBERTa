QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
In a patient presenting in the second decade of life with a progressive picture of parkinsonism, tremor, dystonia and behavioral alteration, you should always perform a study to rule out the presence of a disease whose appropriate treatment can improve neurological symptoms and stop the clinical course. What disease is it?
1- Huntington's disease.
2- Wilson's disease.
3- Tourette's syndrome.
4- Sydenham's chorea.
5- Juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The key in the question is "stopping the clinical course", as Hungtinton's disease, Tourette's and Parkinson's disease do not have treatments that can stop the clinical course. Sydenham's chorea is typical of younger children with a history of streptococcal infection and resolution is usually spontaneous. On the other hand, in clinical cases it is recommended to rule out Wilson's disease in young patients with movement and neuropsychiatric disorders.
