T1	Premise 69 161	A 45-year-old woman presents arterial hypertension (190/120 mmHg) accompanied by K 2.5 mEq/l
T2	Premise 163 224	An abdominal ultrasound shows stenosis of both renal arteries
T3	Diagnostics 166 186	abdominal ultrasound
T4	Claim 274 283	Enalapril
T5	Claim 288 298	Propanolol
T6	Claim 303 312	Amiloride
T7	Claim 317 325	Prazosin
T8	Claim 330 340	Amlodipine
T9	Treatment 274 283	Enalapril
T10	Treatment 288 298	Propanolol
T11	Treatment 303 312	Amiloride
T12	Treatment 317 325	Prazosin
T13	Treatment 330 340	Amlodipine
T14	Claim 360 437	If the renal arteries are stenosed, blood has difficulty reaching the kidneys
R1	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T14	
T15	Claim 439 580	That is, both are poorly perfused and can only create the pressure gradient necessary for filtration by contraction of the efferent arteriole
T16	Marker 439 446	That is
T17	Claim 582 703	If we administer an ACEI, we will provoke the relaxation of this arteriole and the fall of the glomerular filtration rate
T18	Claim 705 790	And if neither kidney filters, because both have arterial stenosis, we have a problem
T19	Marker 736 743	because
