T2	Claim 214 259	Recent blood loss through the digestive tract
T3	Claim 264 288	Intestinal malabsorption
T4	Claim 293 315	Polymyalgia rheumatica

R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T4	
R3	Support Ent1:T6 Ent2:T4	
T9	Claim 680 799	1: if it is a recent loss, the MCV could remain normal, but the ferritin should be affected, and certainly not elevated
R4	Attack Ent1:T1 Ent2:T9	
R5	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T2	
T10	Claim 801 870	2: the same. If it is due to Fe malabsorption, ferritin should be low
