T1	Premise 59 315	Woman with hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in whom the following parameters are objectified after insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter: cardiac index 1.4 L/min/m2, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 25 mmHg and systemic vascular resistances 2000 dynes/m2
T2	Claim 367 378	Cardiogenic
T3	Claim 383 389	Septic
T4	Claim 394 405	Hypovolemic
T5	Claim 410 422	Anaphylactic
T6	Premise 449 705	We are not given any further data on the patient except that she is in shock (tissue hypoperfusion) and on introducing a Swan-Ganz catheter we find a low cardiac index (<2), elevated PCP (25mmHg) and elevated systemic resistances (normal: 600-1200 dyne/m2)
T7	Claim 707 765	These data are compatible with cardiogenic origin of shock
