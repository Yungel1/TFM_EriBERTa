In the complementary studies she presented red blood cells 3,164,000, Hto. 32%, Hb 11g/dl, MCV 69 fl, Leukocytes 7800, Platelets 370,000, CRP 0.29 mg/dl, Fe 20ng/ml, Ferritin 18 ng/ml, Glucose 105 mg/dl, GOT, GPT, GGT, Alkaline F, total Bilirubin, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Calcium and Phosphorus normal.

Intestinal transit without alterations. Ultrasound of the abdomen without alterations. Which of the following examinations do you consider most appropriate to complete the study?
1- Jejunum biopsy.
2- Arteriography.
3- Endoscopic capsule.
4- Radioisotopes.
5- Pelvic MRI.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
It is a study of iron deficiency anemia with normal gastroscopy and colonoscopy, having ruled out possible celiac disease. We have yet to see jejunum and ileum, so we will have to perform a capsule endoscopy. In iron deficiency anemia, a digestive cause must always be ruled out.
