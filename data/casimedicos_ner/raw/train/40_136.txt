QUESTION TYPE: OTOLARYNGOLOGY AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 64-year-old smoker and heavy drinker reports painless right jugulodigastric lymphadenopathy of progressive growth in the last two months whose fine needle aspiration was reported as squamous cell carcinoma. Which of the following is the most likely location of the primary tumor:
1- Scalp.
2- Parotid.
3- Lung.
4- Esophagus.
5- Larynx.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
You are in the middle of the ENT block. You have already passed the Pneumology and Digestive blocks. Dermatology is still to come out, but a dermatologist (answer 1) would not ask this. So we are left with parotid and larynx; but parotid squamous cell carcinoma is rare; I would mark 5 and rest easy. Perhaps because all the adenopathies at this level that I have seen have ended up corresponding to carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
