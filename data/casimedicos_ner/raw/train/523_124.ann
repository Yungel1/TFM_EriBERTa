T1	Premise 51 219	A 45-year-old patient was diagnosed with HIV infection three months ago, presenting at that time with CD4 45 lymphocytes/µl and an HIV-1 viral load of 500,000 copies/ml
T2	Premise 221 264	At that time he had a negative Mantoux test
T3	Premise 266 421	He started treatment with an integrase inhibitor and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and at one month he had 25,000 copies and CD4 had risen to 80/µL
T4	Premise 423 525	She consulted for presenting a picture of cervical lymphadenopathy and fever of two weeks of evolution
T5	Premise 527 626	The puncture of one of the lymph nodes showed isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas
T6	Claim 631 708	It is a lymph node tuberculosis related to an incomplete immunologic recovery
T7	Claim 713 767	Treatment failure and it is an opportunistic infection
T8	Claim 772 857	This is an opportunistic infection unmasked within a picture of immune reconstitution
T9	Claim 862 908	A negative Mantoux test rules out tuberculosis
T10	Premise 935 1232	We are dealing with a patient with HIV infection in a situation of severe immunosuppression (<50 CD4+) and a very high viral load, who has followed the expected evolution from the immunovirological point of view after the start of treatment (after 12 weeks, the viral load has ostensibly decreased

T11	Claim 1235 1264	answer 2 would not be correct
R2	Attack Ent1:T11 Ent2:T7	
T12	Claim 1360 1466	although in patients with higher CV like ours, it could take longer - and the CD4+ count has begun to rise

T13	Claim 1469 1523	A negative Mantoux test does not rule out tuberculosis
T14	Claim 1266 1358	remember that it is desirable that it becomes negative 24 weeks after the start of treatment

T21	Claim 1623 1789	The diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis is immediate when detecting "isolated acid-fast bacilli and epithelioid granulomas" in the puncture of one of the lymph nodes
T22	Claim 1791 2001	however: considering the patient profile, this process will have been clinically unmasked during the immunological reconstitution and the infection is not the consequence of an incomplete immunological recovery
