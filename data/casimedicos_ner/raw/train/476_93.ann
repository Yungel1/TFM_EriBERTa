T1	Premise 45 190	A 58-year-old hypertensive man comes to the emergency department for a 30-second syncope while jogging, with spontaneous recovery and no sequelae
T2	Premise 192 221	Blood pressure is 135/65 mmHg
T3	Premise 223 353	Cardiac auscultation shows a loud, intense systolic murmur, which is reduced with Valsalva maneuvers and an attenuated second tone
T4	Premise 355 476	The ECG shows sinus rhythm at 72 bpm, with criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy and inverted T waves in anterior face
T5	Claim 514 569	The clinical picture suggests pulmonary thromboembolism
T6	Disease 544 569	pulmonary thromboembolism
T7	Claim 574 690	The data provided indicate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract
T8	Disease 601 690	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract
T9	Claim 695 742	These data correspond to severe aortic stenosis
T10	Claim 747 824	Aortic dissection should be excluded by contrast-enhanced computed tomography
T11	Disease 720 742	severe aortic stenosis
T12	Disease 747 764	Aortic dissection
T13	Marker 775 783	excluded
T14	Diagnostics 787 824	contrast-enhanced computed tomography
T15	Claim 851 1031	The data provided on the characteristics of the murmur (it DECREASES with Valsalva) and the data on left ventricular hypertrophy, lead us to the diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis
