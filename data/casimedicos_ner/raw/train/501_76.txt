QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 5-year-old boy diagnosed with chronic renal failure. He comes to the emergency department with vomiting, malaise, and palpitations. An electrocardiogram was performed with T-wave elevation and blood tests showed potassium levels of 5.9 mEq/L. Immediate administration of calcium gluconate is decided. What is the purpose of this treatment?
1- Encourage the displacement of potassium from the plasma space to the intracellular space.
2- Chelate circulating potassium to favor its hepatic elimination.
3- Chelate circulating potassium to favor its renal elimination.
4- Antagonize the action of potassium on the myocardial cell membrane.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Calcium gluconate has no effect on blood potassium levels (therefore options 1, 2 and 3 are ruled out). Its function is to decrease the excitability of cardiac myocytes to decrease the likelihood of developing heart rhythm disorders.
