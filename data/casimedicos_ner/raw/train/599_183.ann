T1	Premise 44 152	A 45-year-old woman with no history of interest consults for dyspneic sensation of about 4 days of evolution
T2	Premise 154 246	Examination shows rhythmic tachycardia, without murmurs and pulmonary auscultation is normal
T3	Premise 248 314	Arterial blood gases showed a pO2 of 70 mmHg and a pCO2 of 32 mmHg
T4	Premise 316 363	Hemogram, renal and hepatic function are normal
T5	Premise 365 462	Prothrombin time 90%, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of 2 to control (N <1.2)
T6	Claim 520 545	Antiphospholipid syndrome
T7	Claim 550 568	Factor V of Leiden
T8	Claim 573 583	Hemophilia
T9	Claim 588 606	Acute pericarditis
T10	Premise 633 729	In this clinical case, we are presented with a woman who rapidly presents dyspnea with hypoxemia
T11	Disease 707 714	dyspnea
T12	Disease 720 729	hypoxemia
T13	Claim 731 782	a picture compatible with pulmonary thromboembolism
R1	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T13	
T14	Disease 757 782	pulmonary thromboembolism
T15	Claim 784 880	The prothrombin time of 90% and the aPTT with a ratio of 2, is translating a coagulation problem
R2	Support Ent1:T5 Ent2:T15	
T16	Claim 886 998	antiphospholipid antibodies can be detected through the prolongation of phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests
T17	Claim 1000 1016	correct answer 1
R3	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T17	
R4	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T17	
R5	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T6	
T18	Claim 1018 1160	On the other hand, although factor V Leiden has been identified as a common cause of familial thrombosis, it would not alter the clotting time
R6	Attack Ent1:T5 Ent2:T18	
T19	Marker 1018 1035	On the other hand
T20	Marker 1037 1045	although
R7	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T7	
T21	Claim 1162 1283	In the case of hemophilia there would be a problem in blood coagulation but it is not a frequent cause of thromboembolism
T22	Marker 1234 1237	but
R8	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T8	
T23	Claim 1285 1448	Finally, although acute pericarditis could manifest itself in 4 days and with tachycardia, the rest of the symptoms or analytical parameters are not characteristic
T24	Marker 1294 1302	although
T25	Marker 1285 1292	Finally
R9	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T9	
T26	Disease 1177 1187	hemophilia
T27	Disease 1046 1061	factor V Leiden
T28	Disease 1303 1321	acute pericarditis
T29	Disease 520 545	Antiphospholipid syndrome
