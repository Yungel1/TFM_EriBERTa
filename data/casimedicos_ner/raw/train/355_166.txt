QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A pregnant woman, 10 weeks pregnant, comes to the emergency room with a blood pressure of 160/105 mmHg. She is in good general condition, with only mild headache, which is the reason for taking her blood pressure. After 4 hours of rest she presented with a blood pressure of 150/95mmHg. A complete blood count is normal and proteinuria is negative. What type of hypertension is present?
1- Moderate preeclampsia.
2- Pregnancy-induced hypertension.
3- Chronic hypertension.
4- Eclampsia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The correct answer is 3. The SEGO in its 2006 protocol "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy" refers that this is chronic hypertension, although diagnosed in pregnancy. This is because it has been diagnosed at 10 weeks of gestation. Above 20 weeks' gestation, we would be talking about preeclampsia (if HT + proteinuria or uterine artery pulsatility index above the 95th percentile), pregnancy-induced hypertension (only HT) or eclampsia (a form of severe preeclampsia).
