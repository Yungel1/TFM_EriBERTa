T11	Premise 84 305	A 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis and repeated expulsive nephritic colic for the past 25 years comes to the emergency room reporting palpitations and severe right lumbar pain for the past 2 hours
T12	Premise 307 372	Urinalysis shows a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria
T13	Premise 374 428	The electrocardiogram confirms a previously unknown AF
T14	Premise 430 494	Blood biochemistry shows a Creat of 0.9, Ca of 11 and LDH of 950
T15	Claim 698 764	In principle, what you tell us does not fit with a nephritic colic
T16	Premise 766 847	The urine is normal (without hematuria, caused by the lithiasis as it progresses)
T17	Premise 849 911	the Creat is normal (it can rise up to 1.9 in nephritic colic)

T18	Premise 913 1096	The increase in LDH is non-specific and can be found in hepatic parenchymal lesions, AMI or pulmonary embolism, as well as in many other less frequent cases (tumors, myopathies, etc.)
T19	Claim 1098 1187	In this case, we have an important risk factor for embolism, which is atrial fibrillation
T20	Premise 1189 1450	which, in addition, being a 45-year-old male, with no previous history, does not seem to respond to an underlying structural heart disease together with right lumbar pain, which could correspond to irritation of the pleura at the level of the right lumbar spine
