T1	Premise 45 156	A couple with a first male child (index case) with cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) come for genetic counseling
T2	Premise 158 288	Molecular diagnosis indicates that the index case is homozygous for the F5O8del mutation and his parents are heterozygous carriers
T3	Premise 290 376	The clinical geneticist will inform them about the mode of transmission of the disease
T4	Claim 409 472	The probability that the next offspring will be affected is 25%
T5	Claim 477 540	The probability that the next offspring will be affected is 50%
T6	Claim 545 615	Having had an affected child, the next offspring will also be affected
T7	Claim 620 763	Having had a homozygous F5O8del child, the next offspring will be heterozygous carriers (67%) or homozygous genotype without the mutation (33%)
T8	Claim 790 829	Both parents are carriers of a mutation
T9	Premise 839 896	they are not sick and have already had a homozygous child
T10	Marker 831 838	because
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T8	
T11	Claim 903 981	the next offspring has a 50% chance of receiving the mutation from each parent
T12	Marker 983 985	so
T13	Claim 986 1042	the probability of receiving it from both is 50%x50%=25%
R2	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T4	
R3	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T11	
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T13
