T2	Premise 114 184	She brings a cytology with a high grade intraepithelial lesion (U-SIL)
T3	Premise 186 336	Subsequently, colposcopy and biopsy were performed on a mosaic area and histology showed a focus of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of 2 mm in length
T4	Claim 408 418	Conization
T5	Claim 423 461	Total hysterectomy without adnexectomy
T6	Claim 466 506	Pelvic radiotherapy with curative intent
T7	Claim 511 541	Repeat a more extensive biopsy
T8	Claim 568 659	According to the SEGO: "Excise the entire lesion so that it can be evaluated histologically
T9	Claim 1326 1387	When they speak of excision, it is synonymous with conization
T10	Claim 661 715	It involves excision of the entire transformation zone
T11	Claim 717 805	In general, the excision should be adapted to the size and characteristics of the lesion
T12	Claim 807 918	Three types of excision are distinguished according to the presence of the endocervical component of the lesion
T13	Claim 920 1324	Excision type 1 (applicable in cases with transformation zone type 1, in which the diathermic loop should not include endocervical canal or exceed 8 mm in depth), excision type 2 (indicated in transformation zones type 2, involves resecting a small part of endocervical canal visible by colposcopy) and excision type 3 (indicated in transformation zones type 3, includes part of endocervical epithelium)"
