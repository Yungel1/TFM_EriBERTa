T21	Claim 741 1114	Although in practice we should pay attention to the shape of the dendrite (the true dendrite is deeper and has terminal bulbs at the end of each branch), and pay attention to the evolution of the pain (in the pseudodendrite after abrasion the pain should improve), when answering a MIR question it is simpler: if it is a dendrite, the first thing we have to think is herpes
