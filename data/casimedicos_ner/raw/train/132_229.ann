T20	Premise 966 1029	a patient with certain history who has: - Schistocytes in smear
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T20	
T22	Claim 1031 1172	indicates microangiopathic anemia, red cell rupture of mechanical cause, which can be seen mainly in PTT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and DIC
T23	Disease 1041 1064	microangiopathic anemia
T24	Disease 1137 1164	autoimmune hemolytic anemia
T25	Disease 1176 1187	Bicytopenia
T26	Claim 1176 1229	Bicytopenia: here the causes can be very, very varied
R2	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T26	
T27	Premise 1233 1263	Elevation of LDH and Bilirubin

T30	Premise 1321 1349	Negative direct Coombs' test
T31	Claim 1351 1438	essential data, indicating that there is no antibody that sticks to the red blood cells
T32	Marker 1367 1377	indicating
T33	Claim 1493 1650	Answer 1: it cannot be because a hemorrhagic transformation does not give such a brutal elevation of LDH and Cr, in addition to not explaining schistocytosis
R5	Attack Ent1:T33 Ent2:T10	
R6	Attack Ent1:T6 Ent2:T10	
T34	Claim 1652 1738	Answer 2: urgent plasmapheresis... in case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, yes
T35	Disease 1698 1733	thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
R7	Support Ent1:T34 Ent2:T11	
T36	Claim 1740 2157	I like this answer because it justifies bicytopenia, since microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is produced by rupture of red blood cells when they are fragmented by ultralong von Willebrand factor multimers in case of deficiency of the ADAMST13 enzyme, resulting in brutal platelet aggregates and the flow cytometer does not count 400 platelets, but a molondron of platelets that form a mass, hence the thrombocytopenia
T37	Marker 1759 1766	because
T38	Marker 1793 1798	since

T39	Disease 1799 1832	microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

T41	Marker 2084 2087	but
T42	Marker 2131 2136	hence
T43	Claim 2159 2223	It also explains the negative direct Coombs, elevated LDH and Cr

R12	Support Ent1:T6 Ent2:T11	
T44	Marker 1833 1844	is produced
T45	Claim 2225 2487	Answer 3: a situation as critical as that patient's indicates that something big is going on and I would not sit and wait for glucocorticoids to take effect...and I do not know right now what pathology gives that symptomatology and has that treatment as standard
R13	Attack Ent1:T45 Ent2:T12	
T46	Treatment 2351 2366	glucocorticoids
T47	Claim 2489 2690	Answer 4: looking for a trigger for DIC...it would make sense if it were not for the fact that in DIC it is VERY characteristic the consumption of coagulation factors, which is not present in this case
R14	Attack Ent1:T47 Ent2:T13	
T48	Claim 2692 2884	Answer 5: a myeloma does not give schistocytosis nor does it have this symptomatology, they would have to give other data that would support this pathology, such as bone pain and hypercalcemia
R15	Attack Ent1:T48 Ent2:T14
