QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 68-year-old man is evaluated for fever, weight loss and dyspnea on exertion. The EP reveals a new aortic diastolic murmur and stigmata of peripheral embolisms. Echocardiography showed a 1 cm vegetation on the aortic valve and two blood cultures isolated penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus bovis. After starting treatment for endocarditis, which of the following examinations could help us in the diagnosis?
1- Glucose tolerance test.
2- Chest X-ray.
3- Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
4- Colonoscopy.
5- Abdominal ultrasound.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Another gift of a question, the association of S.bovis endocarditis and colon cancer. By the way, it is funny that they give Chest Rx as a test to be performed..... are you telling me that a patient with fever and dyspnea will have an echocardiogram before a simple chest x-ray? And on the other hand... why don't those who write the MIR ask shorter questions without so much back and forth? If what they want is to ask the test to be performed on a patient with S. bovis endocarditis, they could ask the question directly without telling us about the patient's moles...
