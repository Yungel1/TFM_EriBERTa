T16	Premise 563 740	We are dealing with a patient who has exhausted the pharmacological route given that he takes everything and has two important problems: genu varum and an important gonarthrosis
R1	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T16	
T17	Claim 742 836	This means that we can do nothing with an arthroscopy, let alone a synovectomy (1 and 5 false)
R2	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T17	
R3	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T6	
R4	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T10	
T18	Claim 838 1014	The genu varum could falsely make us think about an osteotomy, however even if we did it and corrected the varus now the damage is already done and the osteoarthrosis is severe
T20	Treatment 890 899	osteotomy
T21	Disease 990 1004	osteoarthrosis
T19	Marker 901 908	however
T22	Claim 1016 1123	Perhaps years ago before the osteoarthritis took place it would have been resolutive but not now (4 false).

T26	Treatment 1161 1170	osteotomy
R8	Attack Ent1:T24 Ent2:T9	
T27	Claim 1271 1569	Finally, we may think that it is best to first try rehabilitation before considering surgery, but I discard this option because the question emphasizes that we have exhausted pharmacological measures (although it could be considered because they have not specified whether it has been tried or not)
