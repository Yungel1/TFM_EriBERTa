T1	Premise 42 197	A 52-year-old patient with stage V chronic kidney disease, secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, receives a cadaver donor kidney graft
T2	Disease 75 99	V chronic kidney disease
T3	Disease 114 158	autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
T4	Premise 199 353	A 34-year-old brother of his comes to visit him and says he does not know if he has the disease because he has never seen a doctor since he was a teenager
T5	Claim 446 482	Genetic mutational and linkage study
T6	Claim 487 513	Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound
T7	Claim 518 575	Helical computed axial tomography with iodinated contrast
T8	Claim 580 606	Abdominal and cerebral MRI
T9	Claim 611 637	Periodic clinical controls

R1	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T6	
T15	Claim 683 709	Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound
R2	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T15	
T16	Diagnostics 683 709	Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound
T17	Claim 711 957	Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound is undoubtedly the most specific and sensitive test for the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease and, above all, the cheapest to demonstrate whether or not the patient's sibling has inherited polycystic kidney disease

T18	Diagnostics 711 737	Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound
T19	Disease 811 836	polycystic kidney disease
T20	Marker 842 851	above all
T21	Marker 741 752	undoubtedly
