T1	Premise 47 107	55-year-old woman, operated on for appendicitis 24 years ago
T2	Premise 153 265	she has started with repeated vomiting after breakfast, about 12 hours ago, associated with abdominal distention
T3	Disease 82 94	appendicitis
T4	Premise 267 341	She presented a diarrhea stool a few hours after the onset of the symptoms
T5	Premise 343 452	Examination revealed abdominal distension, tympanism and increased bowel sounds, but no peritoneal irritation
T6	Premise 454 494	Laboratory tests showed no abnormalities
T7	Premise 496 593	The abdominal X-ray showed dilatation of the small bowel loops, without gas in the rectal ampulla
T8	Claim 635 716	This is a picture of intestinal flange obstruction requiring emergency laparotomy
T9	Claim 721 804	Most likely we are facing a case of obstruction at the level of the large intestine
T10	Claim 809 984	The fact that the patient presented a diarrheal stool allows us to exclude the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction. Further imaging studies are necessary to ensure a diagnosis
T11	Claim 989 1051	We should indicate the practice of a decompressive colonoscopy
T12	Claim 1056 1203	Initial management should be conservative, with serum therapy, nasogastric aspiration and periodic clinical, analytical and radiographic monitoring
T13	Claim 1223 1344	This is a typical description of a picture of intestinal obstruction due to bridging or adhesions due to previous surgery
T14	Claim 1346 1379	The correct answer is 5 and not 1
T15	Marker 1380 1387	because
T16	Claim 1388 1462	most of these situations resolve spontaneously with conservative treatment
