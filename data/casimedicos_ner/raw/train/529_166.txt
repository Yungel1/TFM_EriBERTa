QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 18-year-old patient consulted for edema. A complete blood test showed proteinuria of 8 g/day without microhematuria, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia with normal renal function. He was empirically administered corticosteroids. After one month, the clinical picture has completely disappeared. What is your diagnostic hypothesis?
1- Amyloidosis.
2- IgA nephropathy or Berger's disease.
3- Alport syndrome.
4- Nephropathy with minimal changes.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
We describe a young patient with criteria of nephrotic syndrome with excellent response to corticosteroids. Without biopsy, the clinical presentation and evolution suggest a nephropathy with minimal changes, which usually presents with normal or slightly altered renal function together with nephrotic syndrome, and which in 85-90% of cases resolves with steroid treatment. The age is the only data that is a bit shaky, since although it is the most frequent cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, it is usually recommended to perform a biopsy prior to treatment in those older than 16 years, in any case it does not admit much discussion.
