QUESTION TYPE: PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 20-year-old woman with a 15 cm solid-cystic ovarian tumor detected by ultrasound after presenting with non-specific abdominal symptoms. In the anatomopathological study of the corresponding specimen, teeth, hairs, areas of intestinal epithelium, areas of squamous epithelium (15%) and bronchial epithelium, as well as neuroectodermal and embryonic elements are found in several of the histological preparations. In reference to this case, point out the correct diagnosis:
1- Teratocarcinoma.
2- Immature teratoma.
3- Mature cystic teratoma.
4- Dysgerminoma.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
After reading the question and the possible answers, we have two tumor and two non-tumor options. At no time are atypical cellular features mentioned, so we can safely rule out tumor lesions, leaving doubts between answers 2 and 3. In this case, we would have to opt for IMMATURE TERATOMA, mentioning the presence of embryonic remains.
