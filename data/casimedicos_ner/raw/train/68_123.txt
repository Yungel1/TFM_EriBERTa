A 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension and ischemic heart disease comes to the emergency department for oppressive chest pain while watching television. In the ED triage consultation, T. art values of 155/95 mmHg and a capillary O2 saturation of 95% are detected. Which of the following is the most correct course of action?
1- Instruct her to go to the waiting room. You will be notified for tests.
2- This patient should be treated in the vital emergency room (shock room).
3- We will notify the cardiologist on duty to evaluate the patient.
4- From the Triage consultation, the patient will be referred to the Coronary Unit.
5- We will do an ECG in less than 10 minutes.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
If the ECG shows ischemic changes, we will obviously treat the patient in the emergency room and notify the cardiologist. If not, you will be treated as if it were angina and observed, with serial enzymes and treatment in the observation area.
