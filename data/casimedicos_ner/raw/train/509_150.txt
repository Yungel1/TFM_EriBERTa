CORRECT ANSWER: 1
They refer to a concept that has emerged relatively recently and is not present in all clinical guidelines as uncomplicated symptomatic diverticular disease. In these cases, the therapeutic trial with rifaximin is recommended, being the true number 1. The absence of acute phase reactants in the CBC suggests that she does not have acute diverticulitis at the time of consultation that would lead us to request an imaging test to rule it out.
