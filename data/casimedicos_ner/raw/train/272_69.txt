QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 60-year-old man with extensive ulcerative colitis of 15 years of evolution and in clinical remission for the last 3 years, comes to our office to be informed about the risk of colorectal cancer and about the possibility of participating in prevention programs. It is correct to inform him that:
1- Ulcerative colitis is only associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in smokers.
2- In her case, given that she is in long-term remission, the screening advised to the general population is considered appropriate.
3- In cases such as yours, it is considered appropriate to undergo periodic colonoscopies with multiple biopsies staggered along the entire colon.
4- In cases such as yours, screening with periodic fecal occult blood tests is considered appropriate, but with a higher frequency than that used in screening the general population.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of colorectal cancer, whether or not they are smokers. It is recommended to start screening 8-10 years after diagnosis of IBD (or earlier if primary sclerosing cholangitis or other events occur during this interval). The recommended techniques are colonoscopy with random biopsies (answer 3) and pancolonic chromoendoscopy with staining, which is currently the gold standard because it detects dysplasia better, although it requires more technical experience.
