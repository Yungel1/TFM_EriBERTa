T1	Premise 42 149	A 67-year-old patient who in the last 6 months, in two routine analyses, presents progressive lymphocytosis
T2	Premise 151 324	In the last one, hemoglobin 15.4 g/dL; leukocytes 18.5 x103/μL with 82% of mature lymphocytes that by flow cytometry express CD5/CD19/CD23 antigens and platelets 240 x103/μL
T3	Claim 368 414	Study of TP53 mutations to establish prognosis
T4	Claim 419 464	Bone aspirate/biopsy to confirm the diagnosis
T5	Claim 469 513	PET/CT to establish the therapeutic attitude
T6	Claim 518 565	New clinical and analytical control in 6 months
T7	Premise 655 737	We are told of a leukocytosis at the expense of lymphocytes with a B-CLL phenotype
T8	Claim 739 785	It seems that there are no other alarming data
T9	Premise 787 813	No clinical data are given
T10	Claim 815 860	so we assume that the patient is asymptomatic
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T10	
T11	Premise 863 879	No cytopenias...
T12	Claim 880 901	Conclusion: FOLLOW UP
R2	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T8	
R3	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T12	
R4	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T12	
R5	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T12	
R6	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T6	
T13	Claim 903 962	The main hesitation with the answer should be with option 1
T14	Claim 964 995	Why do I consider it incorrect?
T15	Claim 996 1199	Because the TP53 mutation, although it establishes prognosis, is not indicated at diagnosis, but when treatment is going to be initiated (first line and prior to successive lines in case they are needed)
T16	Claim 1201 1328	It would be possible to go too far in this question in which the percentage given does not refer directly to clonal lymphocytes
T17	Claim 1330 1383	so that it could even be a monoclonal B lymphocytosis
T18	Claim 1385 1410	But this is going too far
T19	Marker 996 1003	Because
T20	Disease 1008 1021	TP53 mutation
T21	Marker 1023 1031	although
T22	Marker 1089 1092	but
T23	Marker 1330 1332	so
T24	Marker 1385 1388	But
R7	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T14	
R8	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T16	
R9	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T17	
R10	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T18	
R11	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T3	
T25	Diagnostics 419 464	Bone aspirate/biopsy to confirm the diagnosis
T26	Diagnostics 469 513	PET/CT to establish the therapeutic attitude
T27	Diagnostics 368 414	Study of TP53 mutations to establish prognosis
T28	Diagnostics 518 565	New clinical and analytical control in 6 months
