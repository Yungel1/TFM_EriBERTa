A 50-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, jaundice, fever and abdominal pain. She has no recent history of blood transfusion, risky sexual contacts or addiction to parenteral drugs. Habitual consumption of 60 grams of alcohol per day during the last five years, consumption that has increased during the previous month due to family problems. Temperature 38.5ºC, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg. Physical examination showed temporal and spatial disorientation, malnutrition, asterixis, jaundice and painful hepatomegaly. No ascites or evidence of peritoneal irritation. Laboratory tests include leukocytes 15,000/microliter with 90% polymorphonuclear, red blood cells 3 million/mm3, hemoglobin 10g/dl, mean corpuscular volume 115 fl, bilirubin 15 mg/dl direct predominance, AST (GOT) 300 IU/L, ALT (GPT) 120 IU/L, GGT 635 IU/L, prothrombin time prolongation greater than 50%. What is the most likely diagnosis of the patient's condition?
1- Hepatic abscess.
2- Acute cholecystitis.
3- Acute cholangitis.

CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Patient with harmful alcohol consumption (60g and female), high fever, hepatic encephalopathy (disorientation, asterixis), very high direct bilirubin, jaundice, painful hepatomegaly, coagulopathy (elevated prothrombin time) and mild elevation of transaminases (less than 5 times the upper limit of normal) suggest acute alcohol hepatitis.
