T1	Premise 41 222	A 39-year-old man who in the last 3 months has had two episodes of wide and involuntary jumping movements of the left limbs, which in about two minutes lead to loss of consciousness
T2	Premise 224 327	In the neuroradiological study a right frontal expansive lesion suggestive of cerebral glioma was found

T6	Claim 457 500	Partial secondarily generalized symptomatic
T7	Premise 527 609	They refer to a partial seizure that is followed by loss of level of consciousness
T8	Marker 611 613	so
T9	Claim 614 809	strictly speaking it would be a symptomatic complex partial seizure, not a secondarily generalized partial seizure (which occurs when tonic-clonic movements extend to the rest of the extremities)

R1	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T9	
R2	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T4	
R3	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T6	
T12	Disease 689 728	secondarily generalized partial seizure
T13	Claim 811 863	For this reason the most correct option would be two
