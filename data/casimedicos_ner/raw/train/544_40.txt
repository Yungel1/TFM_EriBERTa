CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Currently the only effective treatment capable of modifying the natural course of respiratory allergy is specific allergen immunotherapy for a minimum of 3 consecutive years. In this patient the conventional treatment has not worked, so it is possible to escalate to specific allergen immunotherapy. It is true that it is not necessary to wait 10 years to start it since it is indicated and its use is allowed if there is clinical relevance in patients older than 5 years. Omalizumab is a biological treatment that would only be indicated in cases of severe moderate bronchial asthma secondary to respiratory allergy.
