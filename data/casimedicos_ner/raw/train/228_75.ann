T1	Premise 45 177	a patient with clinical signs of heart failure who presents with ascites disproportionately elevated in relation to peripheral edema
T2	Claim 217 239	Severe aortic stenosis
T3	Claim 244 312	Dilated cardiomyopathy with significant left ventricular dysfunction
T4	Claim 317 347	Primary pulmonary hypertension
T5	Claim 352 391	Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T6	Claim 396 421	Constrictive pericarditis
T7	Premise 441 518	They tell us about clinical symptoms of right failure, with edema and ascites
T8	Claim 520 595	Therefore, we rule out left heart failure: EAo, dilated with DSVI and a MHO
T9	Marker 520 529	Therefore
T10	Marker 534 542	rule out
R1	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T2	
R2	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T3	
R3	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T5	
T11	Claim 597 795	Of the two we are left with, in constrictive pericarditis we have increased filling pressures in right chambers, which cause retrograde pressure increase with hepatic congestion, ascites, edema, etc
T12	Claim 797 921	On the contrary, in pulmonary hypertension, the tricuspid valve is responsible (a priori) for "containing" this overpressure
T13	Marker 797 812	On the contrary
R4	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T11	
R5	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T6	
T14	Disease 217 239	Severe aortic stenosis
T15	Disease 244 312	Dilated cardiomyopathy with significant left ventricular dysfunction
T16	Disease 317 347	Primary pulmonary hypertension
T17	Disease 352 391	Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T18	Disease 396 421	Constrictive pericarditis
