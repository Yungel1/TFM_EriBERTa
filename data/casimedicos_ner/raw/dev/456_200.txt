QUESTION TYPE: OPHTHALMOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 67-year-old man, diabetic and asthmatic, with primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes. He has an ocular pressure of 34 mmHg in his right eye and 31 mmHg in his left eye. Which of the following pharmacological groups is the most indicated as first choice as hypotensive treatment?
1- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
2- Beta-blockers.
3- Alpha-2 agonists.
4- Prostaglandin derivatives.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
We are asked about the first choice treatment for glaucoma. In the past, beta-blockers were the first choice, but nowadays they have been displaced by the group that lowers intraocular pressure the most: prostaglandins. Their efficacy and more convenient dosage (once a day) generally make them the group of choice. Beta-blockers would remain as a second choice in cases in which the side effects of prostaglandins (change in eye color, increase in eyelash size) make us initially leave them aside. Since the patient is asthmatic, we should rule out beta-blockers (wrong answer 2). Also, since we need a significant drop in intraocular pressure because the numbers are high (34 and 31), we can also rule out carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and alpha-2 agonists (options 1 and 3 incorrect). And opt for the group that can lower intraocular pressure the most. Answer 4 correct. And then a couple of nuances of the statement. It would be more correct to talk about intraocular pressure and not "ocular pressure". And the wording could be improved so as not to repeat the word "as" in the last sentence.
