QUESTION TYPE: NEUROSURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 13-year-old boy presents with subacute headache and diplopia. Neurologic examination shows vertical gaze palsy and MRI shows a contrast-enhancing lesion in the pineal region obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius. The most likely diagnosis is:
1- Glioblastoma.
2- Medulloblastoma.
3- Germ cell tumor.
4- Meningioma.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Germinal tumors are the most frequent in children in the pineal region. They usually capitate homogeneously and cause triventricular hydrocephalus and Parinaud. Glioblastomas usually occur in adults at the lobar level, medulloblastomas are the most frequent malignant tumors at the posterior fossa level in children (vermis and roof of the IV ventricle) but rare at the pineal level and meningiomas are rare in children and also in the pineal region.
