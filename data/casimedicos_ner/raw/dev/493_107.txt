QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 18-year-old patient comes to the emergency department with epistaxis of several days' evolution, with no personal or family history of interest. On examination he is afebrile, multiple ecchymoses are observed, no splenomegaly is palpable. Laboratory tests: leukocytes 7.2 x103/μL, Hb 12.3 g/dL, platelets 6.0 x103/μL. Thrombocytopenia is confirmed in the smear, where platelets of increased size are observed. Coagulation and biochemistry studies are normal. What do you consider the most probable diagnosis?
1- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
2- Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
3- Thrombocytopenia induced by infection.
4- Primary immune thrombocytopenia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
If they wanted us to answer that it is a TTP (answer 1) they would probably associate anemia and in the smear they would surely tell us about schistocytes. Not to say that the patient's symptoms would probably be much more than epistaxis. The other two answers, you do not have to hesitate with them. Nothing points to that.
