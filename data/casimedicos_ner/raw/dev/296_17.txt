QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 47-year-old man, active smoker, with a history of drug abuse by parenteral route comes to the ED for a 2-hour evolution of acute onset pleuritic left costal pain and progressive dyspnea until becoming resting. In the previous 2 weeks he had presented febrile fever, general malaise and dry cough. On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg. The trachea is deviated to the right side and auscultation shows complete absence of vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax. HIV serology is positive and shows an ADC lymphocyte count of 176 cells/ml. What is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Subpleural emphysematous bulla rupture.
2- Community-acquired necrotizing bacterial pneumonia.
3- Pulmonary tuberculosis.
4- Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Patient with risk factor for HIV acquisition, who comes to the emergency department for a subacute onset of 2 weeks of evolution (fever, malaise and dry cough) that worsens abruptly (pleuritic pain) and progressively (dyspnea). Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection the clearest option goes for pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania. Although the frequency of the different opportunistic infections has varied as a consequence of the administration of highly effective antiretroviral treatments, our patient would be in a setting where he has not yet received HAART.
