QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 46-year-old male parenteral drug user came to the emergency department with fever with chills, mental confusion, diffuse myalgias and intense pain in the left hand of 24 hours of evolution without clear local phlogosis signs. She does not refer any traumatic history. Examination revealed: temperature 38.9°C, 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 30/min, blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with left deviation (25,000 leukocytes/mm3, 80% neutrophils); increased creatinine (1.6 mg/dL) and CK (138 U/L). Among the following, which is the most likely diagnosis:
1- Streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis.
2- Gangrene due to Clostridium spp.
3- Mycobacterial cellulitis.
4- Erysipelas.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
I have my doubts between 1 and 2; exceptionally C. botulinum can infect traumatic or puncture wounds in IVDUs using brown heroin or cause sinusitis in cocaine addicts. On the other hand, the case may refer to a severe sepsis with poor initial manifestation at first sight, with incipient rhabdomyolysis and muscle pain, in this case it may be a necrotizing fasciitis, where the most frequently implicated germ is S. pyogenes.
