T1	Premise 42 188	An 18-year-old patient comes to the emergency department with epistaxis of several days' evolution, with no personal or family history of interest
T2	Premise 190 282	On examination he is afebrile, multiple ecchymoses are observed, no splenomegaly is palpable
T3	Premise 284 361	Laboratory tests: leukocytes 7.2 x103/μL, Hb 12.3 g/dL, platelets 6.0 x103/μL
T4	Premise 363 453	Thrombocytopenia is confirmed in the smear, where platelets of increased size are observed
T5	Premise 455 502	Coagulation and biochemistry studies are normal
T6	Claim 557 592	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
T7	Claim 597 635	Disseminated intravascular coagulation
T8	Claim 640 677	Thrombocytopenia induced by infection
T9	Claim 682 713	Primary immune thrombocytopenia
T10	Claim 740 894	If they wanted us to answer that it is a TTP (answer 1) they would probably associate anemia and in the smear they would surely tell us about schistocytes
R1	Attack Ent1:T10 Ent2:T6	
T11	Claim 896 977	Not to say that the patient's symptoms would probably be much more than epistaxis
R2	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T10	
T12	Disease 557 592	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
T13	Disease 597 635	Disseminated intravascular coagulation
T14	Disease 640 677	Thrombocytopenia induced by infection
T15	Disease 682 713	Primary immune thrombocytopenia
T16	Claim 979 1039	The other two answers, you do not have to hesitate with them
T17	Claim 1041 1063	Nothing points to that
