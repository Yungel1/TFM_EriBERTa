T1	Claim 750 812	Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated mixed alkalosis
T2	Claim 672 745	Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated metabolic acidosis
T3	Claim 428 496	Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated respiratory alkalosis
T4	Disease 428 496	Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated respiratory alkalosis
T5	Claim 501 576	Acute metabolic alkalosis with hypoxemic and hypocapnic respiratory failure
T6	Disease 501 576	Acute metabolic alkalosis with hypoxemic and hypocapnic respiratory failure
T7	Claim 581 667	Chronic normocapnic respiratory insufficiency, without alteration of acid-base balance
T8	Disease 581 667	Chronic normocapnic respiratory insufficiency, without alteration of acid-base balance
T9	Disease 672 745	Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated metabolic acidosis
T10	Disease 750 812	Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated mixed alkalosis
T11	Premise 77 261	A 67-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (treated with ramipril and furosemide) and type 2 diabetes (treated with insulin) comes to the emergency room for dyspnea
T12	Premise 263 370	Blood gas analysis performed while breathing room air shows pH 7.45, paO2 56, PaCO2 30 mm Hg, HCO3 26 mm Hg
T13	Premise 862 988	The separate findings are: normal pH but with alkalosis tendency, acute respiratory failure, hypocapnia and normal bicarbonate
T14	Claim 990 1037	The most appropriate answer seems to me to be 1
T15	Marker 1039 1044	since
T16	Premise 1045 1175	the patient does not present a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate would be higher), much less an acidosis (bicarbonate would be low)
R1	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T14	
R2	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T14	
T17	Claim 1177 1237	The alkalosis is not mixed either, but is mainly respiratory
R3	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T14	
T18	Marker 1420 1429	Therefore
T19	Claim 1430 1463	I believe the correct answer is 1
T20	Premise 1320 1418	the kidney which always compensates later is starting to retain HCO3 to compensate and maintain pH
T21	Premise 1239 1314	The patient is probably hyperventilating because of her respiratory failure
