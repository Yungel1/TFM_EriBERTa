T6	Claim 449 475	Obturator nerve neuropathy
T7	Claim 480 511	Neuropathy of the sciatic nerve
T8	Claim 538 651	The femoral nerve (although rare) may be damaged in a cesarean section, hysterectomy or lower abdominal operation
R1	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T8	
T9	Claim 653 728	This nerve injury produces hypoesthesia and weakness along its distribution
T10	Disease 680 692	hypoesthesia
R2	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T9	
R3	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T4	
R4	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T4	
T11	Claim 730 895	Femoroneuropathy is manifested by paralysis (25% of cases) of the quadriceps muscles, abolition of patellar reflexes and hypoesthesia of the anterior and inner thigh
R5	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T11	
T12	Disease 730 746	Femoroneuropathy
R6	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T4	
T13	Claim 897 927	Therefore, answer 1 is correct
T14	Marker 897 906	Therefore
R7	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T13	
R8	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T13	
R9	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T13	
R10	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T4	
T15	Claim 929 1125	The femoral cutaneous or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2,L3) is only sensitive and is responsible for the sensitivity of the skin of the lateral and anterior aspect of the thigh up to the knee
T16	Claim 1130 1176	it would not explain the motor problem of gait
R11	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T16	
R12	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T15	
T17	Marker 1127 1129	so
T18	Claim 1181 1191	2 is false

R16	Attack Ent1:T3 Ent2:T15	
T19	Claim 1193 1237	The obturator nerve (L2-L4) is a mixed nerve
T20	Claim 1239 1367	At the motor level, it invests the obturator externus, pectineus, short approximator, the approximators (adductors) and gracilis
T21	Claim 1369 1469	At the sensory level the capsule of the coxofemoral joint, medial aspect of the thigh above the knee
R17	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T19	
R18	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T19	
T22	Claim 1471 1597	Therefore neither affects the sensitivity of the anterior aspect of the thigh nor the extension of the knee so that 3 is false
T23	Marker 1579 1586	so that
R19	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T6	
T24	Marker 1471 1480	Therefore
R20	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T22	
R21	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T22	
T25	Claim 1599 1893	A lesion of the sciatic nerve at motor level affects to the flexion of the knee not to its extension and at distal level to this one (they do not count anything of distal clinic) and at sensitive level also it is distal in the external face of the leg and in the foot reason why 4 also is false
