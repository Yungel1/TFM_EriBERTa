T1	Premise 55 251	An 8-year-old girl (index case) is clinically diagnosed as having neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Recklinghausen's disease with multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules.
T2	Disease 121 183	neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Recklinghausen's disease
T3	Premise 252 337	Her father (not diagnosed with NF1) died in a traffic accident at the age of 38 years
T4	Premise 339 526	On examination, the mother presents two café-au-lait spots and attends the genetic counseling consultation with her new partner where a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is proposed
T5	Claim 562 660	Yes, as the mother has 2 café-au-lait spots, she is a carrier and PGD is indicated with these data
T6	Claim 666 769	t is indicated after detection of the causative mutation in the index case and eventually in his mother
T7	Disease 283 286	NF1
T8	Diagnostics 475 513	preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD
T9	Diagnostics 531 534	PGD
T10	Diagnostics 628 631	PGD
T11	Claim 774 891	It is not indicated because NF1 responds to mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2), with recessive inheritance
T12	Disease 802 805	NF1
T13	Marker 794 801	because
T14	Claim 896 1019	No, two café-au-lait spots are not diagnostic and your new partner is very unlikely to be a carrier (NF1 is a rare disease)
T15	Disease 996 1000	(NF1
T16	Claim 1024 1161	With these data, PGD is indicated, consisting of selecting embryos in vitro, to implant in the maternal uterus those without the mutation
T17	Diagnostics 1041 1044	PGD
T18	Claim 1181 1289	The first step is to detect the mutation and once detected, if the mother is a carrier, to proceed with PGD.
T19	Diagnostics 1285 1288	PGD
