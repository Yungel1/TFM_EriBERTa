QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 40-year-old man, with no history of interest, presents with acute arthritis of the right knee of 5 days of evolution as well as fever up to 37.7°C. He has no history of trauma. He presented with joint effusion, warmth on palpation and functional limitation due to pain. Diagnostic arthrocentesis was performed and showed 30000 cels/microliter with predominance of neutrophils. Polarized light examination revealed rhomboidal and cylindrical crystals with weakly positive birefringence. On plain radiograph of the knee, radiodense deposits are found in the external meniscus of the knee. Mark the FALSE answer:
1- Initial treatment will consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as aspiration of synovial fluid.
2- It is advisable to perform a synovial fluid culture to rule out infectious synovitis.
3- Once the acute flare-up has passed, treatment with allopurinol should be started to reduce the incidence of new arthritis flare-ups in the future.
4- The most likely diagnosis is acute arthritis due to calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (pseudogout).
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
It is a chondrocalcinosis. There is no treatment for this disease, only treatment for flare-ups (colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids), although sometimes if the flare-ups are habitual the colchicine is maintained. Allopurinol has not shown any efficacy in this microcrystal arthropathy, but it has shown efficacy in gout.
