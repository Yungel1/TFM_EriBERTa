QUESTION TYPE: ANESTHESIOLOGY AND CRITICAL CARE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 30-year-old man suffers fall from a standing height of 2 meters. On arrival at the ER, he is cyo, catheterized with clear urine. He shows swelling of the left heel, as well as mild tingling in the anterior aspect of the right thigh and scrotum, and dysesthesia in both feet. The patient says goodbye to the stretcher-bearer with a handshake, with a simultaneous pat on the shoulder. Rotation of the MMII on the stretcher grasped by the ankles is painless and compression of the pelvis is asymptomatic. Next:
1- We will sit him on the stretcher to be able to explore the cervical spine.
2- We will refer to Rx to perform lower extremities study.
3- Palpate the abdomen and rotate it en bloc to palpate the thoracolumbar spine.
4- Place a cervical collar and refer to radiology for cervical spine and lower extremity imaging.
5- We will request an abdominal echo.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
From the symptoms reported, tingling in the anterior thigh, scrotum and dysesthesia in the feet, there seems to be a vertebral involvement at L2-3 and sacral roots, so the correct thing to do would be to perform a radiological examination without mobilizing the patient. But it is necessary to mobilize him to explore him, obviously, en bloc. The cervical spine seems to be undamaged because the patient mobilizes both arms adequately, without paresthesia.
