QUESTION TYPE: ANESTHESIOLOGY, CRITICAL CARE AND EMERGENCIES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 67-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (treated with ramipril and furosemide) and type 2 diabetes (treated with insulin) comes to the emergency room for dyspnea. Blood gas analysis performed while breathing room air shows pH 7.45, paO2 56, PaCO2 30 mm Hg, HCO3 26 mm Hg. What gasometric alteration does the patient present?
1- Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated respiratory alkalosis.
2- Acute metabolic alkalosis with hypoxemic and hypocapnic respiratory failure.
3- Chronic normocapnic respiratory insufficiency, without alteration of acid-base balance.
4- Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated metabolic acidosis.
5- Hypoxemic respiratory failure with compensated mixed alkalosis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
I found this question tricky. The separate findings are: normal pH but with alkalosis tendency, acute respiratory failure, hypocapnia and normal bicarbonate. The most appropriate answer seems to me to be 1, since the patient does not present a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate would be higher), much less an acidosis (bicarbonate would be low). The alkalosis is not mixed either, but is mainly respiratory. The patient is probably hyperventilating because of her respiratory failure, and the kidney which always compensates later is starting to retain HCO3 to compensate and maintain pH. Therefore I believe the correct answer is 1.
