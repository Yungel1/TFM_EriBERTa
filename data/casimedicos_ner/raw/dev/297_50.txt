QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 58-year-old man reported a weeks-long history of progressive, mildly painful skin lesions on his left arm. It had started as an erythematous lesion on his left thumb. He had visible reddish striae as connecting lines between the lesions. The patient had no fever or other general symptoms. He had been working in his garden but did not remember any injuries. The etiologic diagnosis was made by culture of a skin biopsy. What is the most likely causative agent of this process?
1- Dermatophytosis by Microsporum gypseum.
2- Cutaneous infection by Staphylococcus aureus.
3- Sporotrichosis.
4- Cutaneous infection by Mycobacterium marinum.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The patient carries out an activity in contact with soil and plants (which are not provided free of charge). The symptoms are chronic, which started distally (left thumb) and are affecting the ipsilateral arm (reddish striae). There were no systemic symptoms. They also comment that the diagnosis was made on the basis of a skin biopsy. Of the microorganisms discussed, Microsporum gypseum does not usually manifest dissemination of infection of a lymphangitic aspect, in general keratinophilic fungi (dermatophytes) do not have any ability to invade deep tissues, so we ruled out this option. Staphylococcus aureus infection can affect superficial and deep tissue layers, they can spread following a lymphangitic path, but it is not usual such a long evolution, it is usually acute (days) and usually accompanied by systemic symptoms, so we discard this option. Mycobacterium marinum (and not Mycobacterum marinum) is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium characterized by being environmental, opportunistic and photochromogenic. It has a slow growth, from 2 to 8 weeks, at a temperature ranging from 30 to 37 °C. It affects different species of fish in cold, warm, fresh or salt water, especially stagnant waters of fish tanks and pools without chlorine. Infection in humans occurs by direct contact with fish or contaminated water in the presence of a loss of continuity in the skin of the host. Our patient has no history of exposure to fish or water (they don't say), so considering that usually the diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and specifically asking for this history, our case is far from this possibility. The Sporothrix schenckii complex is the causative agent of Sporotrichosis, this dimorphic fungus is located in the soil, the complex is formed by 5 species, S. schenckii sensu strictu, S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, capable of causing human and animal disease; the other two are S. mexicana and S. albicana not associated with any disease. Patients are usually infected by exposure to soil by means of a sharp object (thorns, stems, animal claws, etc.) and have a slow evolution, affect deep tissues and their dissemination typically follows a pathway as described in the question.
