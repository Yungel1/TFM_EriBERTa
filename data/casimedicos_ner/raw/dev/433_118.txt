QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND MICROBIOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
Luis is a 25-year-old young man who underwent splenectomy after a bicycle accident 1 year ago. He has a dog that bit him 24 hours ago and has caused a small wound on his right hand. She comes to her health center (located 3 hours from the nearest hospital) with fever of 39°C, pain in the wound and general malaise. On examination, BP 100/60 mm Hg, HR 110 beats per minute, slight swelling in the wound without pus. Which of the following actions is most indicated at this time?
1- Send to hospital for rabies and tetanus vaccination and keep under observation.
2- Clean the wound and administer intramuscular nonspecific gamma globulin.
3- Give 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin and send to hospital.
4- Give clindamycin 600 mg orally every 8 hours and observation.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
This question has been complicated for us. The question does not have all the necessary information, but using what we have we can try to answer. The dog is domestic, known and can be monitored, so we would have to wait for the observation period to pass and prophylaxis is not recommended. At this point we will only have to worry about the possible bacteremia that may be occurring in a patient with the possibility of high risk due to asplenia. The treatment of choice in dog bite is amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but it is not available, so we can use another treatment such as clindamycin plus cephalosporin or clindamycin + moxifloxacin but it is not contemplated among the alternatives. In a first attempt we answered 4, but the correct answer is 3, because of the second part of the question; it is a high risk patient with incipient signs of sepsis so he should be sent to the hospital, here the key more than the antibiotic is in the position to take, in the second part of each answer. It could be challenged since they do not say in which community the bite occurred (if it was in Ceuta or Melilla the protocol may vary).
