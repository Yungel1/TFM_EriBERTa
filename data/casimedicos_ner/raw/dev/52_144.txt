QUESTION TYPE: PSYCHIATRY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 36-year-old patient from another culture who has been living in Spain for the last 4 years presents at a National Health Service office. He reports presenting with anxious symptoms and depressive mood for the last 10 months. This condition moderately interferes with her daily activities. She has no previous psychiatric history. This situation is the result of the death, in a car accident, of an older brother with whom he was very close. Indicate which of the following diagnoses is appropriate:
1- Major depression.
2- Bipolar II disorder.
3- Adjustment disorder.
4- Dysthymia.
5- Cyclothymia.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The relative mildness of the symptoms, which do not seriously interfere with daily activities, excludes in principle the diagnosis of major depression. There is no evidence of hypomanic phases to justify a bipolar II disorder. Dysthymia requires a duration of at least two years. Cyclothymia is a very rare diagnosis nowadays (because, as Castilla del Pino said in an interview, what used to be cyclothymics are now called bipolar, contributing to one of the multiple psychiatric epidemics of our time), which consists of oscillations between the depressive pole and the manifest, mild. But there are no data on such oscillations. The correct answer is, in all probability, 3. The adaptive disorder appears within 3 months after the stressful event and does not last more than 6 months if the stressful event or its consequences have ceased (which is not the case because the brother of the imaginary patient is still dead). Mild anxious-depressive symptoms fit such a diagnosis. One more example of how to conceptualize as illness what are facts (albeit painful) of life. Surely the imaginary patient takes some antidepressant because maybe something helps (1).
