QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 45-year-old male brought to the consultation by his relatives for a one-year history of memory loss, which has progressed to the point of needing help with some activities of daily living. He has a history of migraines and some episode of self-limited neurological focality for which he has never consulted. The neuropsychological examination is compatible with an initial dementia and the brain MRI shows a severe leukoencephalopathy. Which test should be ordered?
1- Lumbar puncture to analyze amyloid and tau protein in CSF.
2- Genetic study for presenilin 1 (PSEN1).
3- Genetic study for NOTCH3.
4- Genetic study for progranulin.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
They describe a characteristic case of CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy). It is a genetic disease of autosomal dominant inheritance by mutation of the NOTCH3 gene. This mutation causes vascular involvement of small vessel that generates severe leukoencephalopathy early, which generates various symptoms. Migraines, cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment at early ages stand out, as shown in the clinical case of the question.
