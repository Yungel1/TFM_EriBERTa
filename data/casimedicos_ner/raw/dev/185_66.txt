QUESTION TYPE: ENDOCRINOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 74-year-old patient with bowel resection following mesenteric thrombosis comes to consult for fatigue and bone pain. He had suffered a Colles' fracture three months earlier. Laboratory tests showed anemia of 9.5 g/dl, microcytic, albumin 3.5 g/di, calcium 7.5 mg/dl, phosphate 2.0 mg/dl and alkaline phosphatase 224 IU (normal up to 120 IU). Radiographs of the femur show radiolucent bands perpendicular to the cortex on the inner side of the upper femur. What is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Osteoporosis.
2- Paget's disease.
3- Osteitis fibrosa.
4- Prostate cancer metastasis.
5- Osteomalacia.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
Although this one had not been assigned to me, I am answering it as well since it deals with an endocrinology topic: vitamin D. In this case there are important data such as the history of intestinal resection, hypocalcemia and hypophosphoremoia; this should lead us to think in a vitamin D deficit due to malabsorption and therefore, in an osteomalacia. The rest of the data: previous fracture, pain and the X-ray support the diagnosis.
