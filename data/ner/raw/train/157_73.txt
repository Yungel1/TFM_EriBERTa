QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY AND ORTHOPEDICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 75-year-old patient with significant gonarthrosis with "Genu Varo" that causes marked functional impotence, limited mobility and continuous pain that requires continuous antirheumatic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication. What treatment should be indicated in this case?
1- Arthroscopic lavage of the knee.
2- Rehabilitation of the affected knee.
3- Arthroplasty of the affected knee.
4- Abduction supratuberosity tibial supratuberosity tibial osteotomy.
5- Knee synovectomy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
We are dealing with a patient who has exhausted the pharmacological route given that he takes everything and has two important problems: genu varum and an important gonarthrosis. This means that we can do nothing with an arthroscopy, let alone a synovectomy (1 and 5 false). The genu varum could falsely make us think about an osteotomy, however even if we did it and corrected the varus now the damage is already done and the osteoarthrosis is severe. Perhaps years ago before the osteoarthritis took place it would have been resolutive but not now (4 false). In addition, in order to consider an osteotomy, we should be given more data to know which bone to apply the osteotomy on, the tibia or the femur. Finally, we may think that it is best to first try rehabilitation before considering surgery, but I discard this option because the question emphasizes that we have exhausted pharmacological measures (although it could be considered because they have not specified whether it has been tried or not). In any case with the knee prosthesis we correct the problem of osteoarthritis pain and we can also correct the knee varus.
