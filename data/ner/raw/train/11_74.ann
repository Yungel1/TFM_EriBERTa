T1	Claim 325 390	As there is no capsular invasion, no further surgery is necessary
T2	Claim 395 476	Follicular pattern is an indication for prophylactic cervical lymph node emptying
T3	Claim 481 552	This is a follicular carcinoma and requires completion of thyroidectomy
T4	Claim 557 657	The report allows us to rule out with total certainty a papillary carcinoma in the remaining thyroid
T5	Claim 662 766	Measurement of plasma calcitonin will allow us to distinguish between papillary and follicular carcinoma
T6	Claim 786 817	I think the correct answer is 3
T7	Claim 818 853	answers 2,4 and 5 are clearly false
T8	Claim 855 883	The doubt is between 1 and 2
T9	Disease 337 357	no capsular invasion
T10	Treatment 359 391	no further surgery is necessary.
T11	Premise 180 289	very cellular follicular pattern without capsular invasion and infiltrating adjacent blood vessels and nerves

T19	Treatment 662 694	Measurement of plasma calcitonin
T20	Claim 1108 1243	it is best to complete the thyroidectomy and perform a radioactive iodine scan to rule out metastases or treat them if they are present
T21	Premise 1014 1105	But if there are data of poor prognosis and the possibility of metastases - as in this case
