T1	Premise 51 156	A 53-year-old woman consults for a fever of 15 days of evolution, without symptoms of infectious focality
T2	Premise 158 303	On examination, a painful hepatomegaly is detected at 5 cm from the costal margin and the spleen is palpated at 14 cm from the left costal margin
T3	Premise 305 432	The blood count showed Hb 8.5 g/dL, leukocytes 630/ml (lymphocytes 63%, monocytes 20%, neutrophils 17%) and platelets 35,000/ml
T4	Premise 434 493	Biochemistry shows moderate elevation of liver biochemistry
T5	Premise 495 589	LDH is normal and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (3.5 g/dL) is observed in the proteinogram
T6	Premise 591 791	He has a history of known HIV infection for 10 years and irregular adherence to antiretroviral treatment, with recent determinations of CD4 lymphocytes 350 cells/mL and HIV viral load of 154 copies/mL
T7	Premise 793 910	For the past 3 months she has been treated for seronegative symmetrical polyarthritis with 10-20 mg/day of prednisone
T8	Claim 961 1058	I would perform a bone marrow biopsy, since the most probable diagnosis is visceral leishmaniasis
T9	Claim 1063 1160	Pancytopenia is justified by C virus-associated cirrhosis and I would not perform further testing
T10	Claim 1165 1270	Probably a medullary toxicity due to prednisone that would be treated with drug withdrawal and filgastrim
T11	Claim 1275 1352	I would request an ANAs determination to rule out disseminated systemic lupus
T12	Claim 1357 1453	I would intensify antiretroviral therapy, as it is likely that all manifestations are due to HIV
T13	Premise 1506 1681	We are told about an HIV patient with irregular follow-up of antiretroviral treatment, presenting fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia
T14	Claim 1683 1738	All these data are suggestive of visceral Leishmaniasis
T15	Claim 1743 1825	an OM biopsy should be performed to look for amastigotes and confirm the diagnosis
