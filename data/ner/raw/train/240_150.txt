QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 76-year-old man consults for cognitive impairment, slowness and clumsiness of movements, of eight months of evolution. The family reports that the patient had visual hallucinations, so his primary care physician prescribed low doses of risperidone, with a significant worsening of motor status. In view of these data, what is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Alzheimer's disease.
2- Dementia due to Lewy bodies.
3- Frontotemporal dementia.
4- Vascular dementia.
5- Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The correct answer is 2 because it presents the case with the typical symptoms of dementia due to Lewy bodies, being the guiding symptom visual hallucinations. Progressive cognitive impairment, parkinsonian motor signs (inferred from clumsiness of movements) and hypersensitivity to neuroleptics even in small doses are also mentioned.
