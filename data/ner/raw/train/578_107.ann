T4	Claim 406 475	She is in the moment of evolution in which vasospasm is more frequent
T5	Claim 480 555	This progressive deterioration is probably secondary to aneurysm rebleeding
T6	Claim 560 618	Subacute deterioration is most likely due to hydrocephalus
T7	Claim 623 681	The diagnostic technique of choice is cerebral angiography
T8	Claim 708 817	Vasospasm as a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs early, in the week after the hemorrhage
