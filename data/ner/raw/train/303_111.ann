T1	Premise 45 265	a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate, prednisone and indomethacin who acutely presents with edema and increased plasma creatinine with poorly expressive urine sediment and proteinuria less than 100 mg/24 h
T2	Claim 295 312	Renal amyloidosis
T3	Claim 317 369	Glomerulonephritis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis
T4	Claim 374 431	Renal failure due to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
T5	Claim 436 478	Interstitial nephritis due to methotrexate
T6	Claim 505 604	Amyloidosis presents with proteinuria usually in the nephrotic range, and has a more chronic course
R1	Attack Ent1:T6 Ent2:T2	
T7	Disease 505 516	Amyloidosis
T8	Claim 606 685	GMN associated with rheumatoid arthritis characteristically alters the sediment
R2	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T6	
T9	Disease 606 609	GMN
R3	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T3	
R4	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T8	
T10	Claim 691 769	renal failure due to NSAIDs has a more chronic course, with papillary necrosis
R5	Attack Ent1:T10 Ent2:T4	
R6	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T10	
T11	Claim 771 1007	Thus, given the course and the alterations described, interstitial nephritis due to methotrexate is more likely, which is more directly toxic than allergic, hence the absence of pyuria, eosinophilia, fever or other hypersensitivity data
R7	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T5	
T12	Marker 771 775	Thus
T13	Disease 825 847	interstitial nephritis
T14	Marker 848 854	due to
R8	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T11	
T15	Disease 295 312	Renal amyloidosis
T16	Disease 317 335	Glomerulonephritis
T17	Marker 336 348	secondary to
T18	Disease 349 369	rheumatoid arthritis
T19	Disease 374 387	Renal failure
T20	Disease 436 458	Interstitial nephritis
