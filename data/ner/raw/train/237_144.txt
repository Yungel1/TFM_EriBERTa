QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
After a traffic accident a 38-year-old patient is admitted to the ICU in coma. After several days the patient does not improve neurologically and a CT scan shows hemorrhagic punctate lesions in the corpus callosum and cortico-subcortical junction. What is the diagnosis?
1- Acute subdural hematoma.
2- Trobocytopenic purpura.
3- Cerebral hemorrhagic contusion.
4- Severe diffuse axonal injury.
5- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Diffuse axonal injury produces an early and sustained deterioration of the level of consciousness (as mentioned in the case statement) without a lesion on CT scan to justify the picture. Sometimes, punctate hemorrhages at the level of the corpus callosum, corticosubcortical junction and dorsolateral portion of the brainstem are evidenced in this imaging test.
