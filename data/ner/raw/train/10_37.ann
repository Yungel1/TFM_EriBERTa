T16	Claim 1378 1431	it does not prolong survival and has a high morbidity
T17	Claim 1433 1665	Surgical bypass has more complications than placing a self-expanding metallic prosthesis that has a median patency of 6 months which is similar to the median survival of a patient with hepatic metastases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma
