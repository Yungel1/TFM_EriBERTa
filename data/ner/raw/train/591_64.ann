T1	Premise 45 129	A 68-year-old woman who wears +4.00 diopter glasses for distance vision in both eyes
T2	Premise 131 288	She consults because since a few weeks ago she has been having eye pain with headache and blurred vision at night when she is watching television in twilight
T3	Claim 359 398	Glaucoma due to primary angular closure
T4	Marker 368 374	due to
T5	Claim 403 411	Migraine
T6	Claim 416 433	Actinic keratitis
T7	Claim 438 454	Dry eye syndrome
T8	Claim 481 581	We are presented with a 68-year-old woman with moderate hyperopia and no history of cataract surgery
R1	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T8	
T9	Claim 583 899	This is not a mere coincidence: the fact that the patient is hyperopic is important, because the eyeballs of hyperopic patients are shorter, with a certain conflict of space in the anterior segment when the crystalline lens undergoes a process of intumescence secondary to age (what patients call incipient cataract)
T10	Marker 668 675	because
R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T9	
T11	Claim 901 1114	In the clinical case, moreover, the ocular and headache pain occurs in scotopic situations, or in situations of dim ambient lighting, which produces an average mydriasis to optimize the light influx to the eyeball
T12	Marker 923 931	moreover
R3	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T11	
T13	Claim 1116 1307	It is evident, therefore, that the patient suffers from primary angular closure processes that possibly self-resolve when the triggering situation ceases, and not a true acute glaucoma attack
T14	Marker 1131 1140	therefore
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T13	
T15	Marker 1275 1278	not
T16	Disease 1172 1195	primary angular closure
T17	Disease 1286 1307	acute glaucoma attack
T18	Claim 1309 1428	But these intermittent angular closures are contemplated within the spectrum of glaucoma due to primary angular closure
T19	Claim 1430 1446	option 1 correct
T20	Marker 1309 1312	But
R5	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T18	
R6	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T19	
R7	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T3	
T21	Claim 1449 1540	Migraine, not being a Neurology question, can sometimes be a confounder in the usual clinic
T22	Disease 1449 1457	Migraine
T23	Claim 1542 1806	however, patients are usually younger, or at least have a clear history of migraine, and, above all, they present symptomatologic worsening with intense sensory stimuli (photophobia and phonophobia), but symptoms are not worsened precisely in cases of dim lighting
T24	Marker 1542 1549	however
R8	Attack Ent1:T1 Ent2:T23	
T25	Marker 1632 1641	above all

T29	Disease 375 398	primary angular closure
T30	Disease 403 411	Migraine
T31	Claim 1829 1965	Actinic keratitis occurs precisely in patients exposed to ultraviolet radiation that is not properly filtered before reaching the cornea
T32	Disease 1829 1846	Actinic keratitis
T33	Claim 1967 2120	it is typical of welders (it is called welder's keratitis), skiers and other people with very intense light exposures and without adequate eye protection
T34	Claim 2122 2136	wrong option 3

R15	Attack Ent1:T2 Ent2:T35	
T37	Claim 2195 2351	ocular discomfort does not go beyond the persistent discomfort that patients might define as pain because of its recently more studied neuropathic component

T39	Marker 2403 2406	but
T40	Claim 2353 2490	Some forms of dry eye may be worse in the evening but others are worse in the morning, and it depends mainly on the frequency of blinking
T41	Claim 2492 2595	In addition, dry eye syndrome is an outdated term; nowadays it is preferred to speak of dry eye disease
T42	Claim 2597 2615	incorrect option 4
