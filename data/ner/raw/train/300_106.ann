T1	Premise 51 155	A 32-year-old man from Cameroon consults for fever cough and left hemithorax pain of 1 month's evolution
T2	Premise 157 235	He took amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 1 week without improvement of symptoms
T3	Premise 237 326	A blood test showed a white blood cell count of 8000/microL and a hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL
T4	Premise 328 418	Chest X-ray showed a loculated left pleural effusion occupying one third of the hemithorax
T5	Premise 420 665	A thoracentesis shows a yellowish fluid with the following features: red blood cells 2000/uL, leukocytes 2500/uL, with 90% lymphocytes, protein 4.9 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 550 U/L, glucose 67 mg/dL, and absence of malignant cells on cytology
T6	Claim 769 809	A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan
T7	Claim 814 842	Pleural fluid pH measurement
T8	Claim 847 898	Measurement of adenosine deaminase in pleural fluid
T9	Claim 903 918	Tuberculin test
T10	Claim 945 1365	The determination of ADA, in the presence of a pneumonia of long evolution that does not improve with antibiotic treatment, with an effusion with abundant leukocytes and lymphocytic predominance, in which the presence of neoplasia is ruled out, with values higher than 70 UI/L, should lead us to have a high degree of suspicion about tuberculous etiology and send the pleural fluid to microbiology for tuberculosis study
