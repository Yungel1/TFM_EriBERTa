T1	Premise 42 244	A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, on treatment with hydroxychloroquine, consults for a feeling of generalized weakness that has progressively developed in the last 15 days
T2	Premise 246 343	The physical examination reveals cutaneous pallor and the CBC shows Hb 7.4 g/dL, Hct 31%, MCV 108
T3	Claim 431 442	Haptoglobin
T4	Claim 447 458	Coombs test
T5	Claim 463 474	Vitamin B12
T6	Claim 479 501	Antinuclear antibodies
T7	Claim 528 603	It tells us about a patient with a diagnosis of lupus and macrocytic anemia
T8	Claim 662 762	The onset of the picture seems relatively rapid and it is also associated with an autoimmune disease
R1	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T7	
T9	Claim 767 846	it seems that they want you to associate it with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia
T10	Marker 764 766	so
R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T9	
T11	Claim 848 899	The low haptoglobin would tell us it is "hemolytic"
T12	Claim 901 949	the coombs test would tell us it is "autoimmune"
T13	Claim 951 962	Vitamin B12
T14	Claim 1061 1155	The ANA would not give us anything in relation to the anemia, since it already has a diagnosis
R3	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T6	
T15	Claim 964 1005	probably the MCV would be higher than 108
T16	Claim 1010 1059	the onset of the clinical picture would be slower
R4	Attack Ent1:T2 Ent2:T15	
R5	Attack Ent1:T1 Ent2:T16	
R6	Attack Ent1:T15 Ent2:T13	
R7	Attack Ent1:T16 Ent2:T13	
R8	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T5	
T17	Claim 1157 1184	Therefore, correct answer 2
T18	Marker 1157 1166	Therefore
R9	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T17	
R10	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T17	
R11	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T17	
R12	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T17	
R13	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T4	
T19	Claim 1186 1280	As a note, autoimmune hemolytic anemias are usually slightly macrocytic due to reticulocytosis
T20	Diagnostics 1065 1068	ANA
T21	Diagnostics 951 962	Vitamin B12
T22	Disease 576 581	lupus
T23	Disease 586 603	macrocytic anemia
T24	Disease 819 846	autoimmune hemolytic anemia
