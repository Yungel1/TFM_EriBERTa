T14	Claim 359 741	Absences behave as brief episodes of abrupt loss of consciousness without alteration of postural control; they typically last seconds and can be repeated many times a day, are usually accompanied by small bilateral motor signs (blinking, chewing) and consciousness is recovered equally abruptly, without subsequent confusion or memory of the episode (MIR 03-04, 248; MIR 97-98, 51).
T15	Claim 742 868	The age of onset is usually between 4 years and early adolescence, being the most frequent cause of seizures in this age range
T16	Claim 870 1096	EEG findings are typically generalized and symmetrical spike-wave discharges at 3 Hz (MIR 99-00F, 67) coinciding with seizures, although in the interictal EEG there are more periods of abnormal activity than clinically visible

T20	Claim 1098 1198	The most appropriate drugs for the treatment of absences are Valproate and Ethosuximide (CTO Manual)
