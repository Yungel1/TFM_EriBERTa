T1	Premise 44 139	A 20-year-old boy consults for lumbosacral pain of inflammatory rhythm of 4 months of evolution
T2	Premise 141 198	Also bilateral thalalgia and morning stiffness for 1 hour
T3	Premise 200 267	In the last 2 months, onset of diarrhea with loss of 4 kg of weight
T4	Claim 318 488	Given the patient's age, he most likely suffers from non-specific low back pain and tendonitis in the feet. If the diarrhea persists, a digestive study would be performed
T5	Claim 493 604	I would perform a digestive study to rule out tumor pathology. The lumbar pain may be due to visceral pathology
T6	Claim 609 717	The clinical picture is very suggestive of spondyloarthritis. Inflammatory bowel disease should be ruled out
T7	Claim 722 822	I would request a lumbar MRI to rule out disc herniation and if diarrhea persists, a digestive study
T8	Disease 652 669	spondyloarthritis
T9	Claim 849 1001	The clinical picture is typical of spondyloarthritis, and together with the digestive symptoms it is probably associated with inflammatory bowel disease
