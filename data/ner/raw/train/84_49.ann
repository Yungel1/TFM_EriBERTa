T11	Premise 63 199	A 75-year-old man, hypertensive and dyslipidemic with a history of heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF < 30%)
T12	Premise 201 274	He comes to our office for worsening of his usual dyspnea in recent weeks
T13	Premise 276 346	His systolic blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg with a heart rate of 65 bpm
T14	Premise 348 441	In the physical examination no crackles were heard and his jugular venous pressure was normal
T15	Premise 443 523	He provides a creatinine determination that is 3.7 mg/dL with ions within normal
T16	Claim 1084 1119	in this case we will use bisoprolol
T17	Marker 1073 1082	Therefore
R1	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T4	
T18	Claim 937 1071	we can worsen renal function and/or increase potassium levels (among diuretics, spironolactone and eplerenone are "potassium-sparing")
T19	Claim 869 929	we must be very careful when using diuretics and ACEI/ARA-II
T20	Marker 931 936	since
T21	Premise 719 867	In a patient with multiple CVRF with concomitant heart and renal failure (presumably of multiple etiology: renal hypoperfusion, arteriosclerosis...)
