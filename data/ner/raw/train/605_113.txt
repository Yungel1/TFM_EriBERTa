QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
35-year-old male, letter carrier, with no history of interest, who comes to the emergency department for acute cervical pain of 24 hours of evolution, without previous trauma, which radiates to the left arm up to the hand and is accompanied by paresthesia in the radial border of the forearm. She presents no objectifiable loss of strength, preserves neck mobility although it is painful and contracture of the paravertebral musculature is appreciated. The first attitude will be:
1- Conservative treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, local heat and relative rest.
2- Urgent call to the neurosurgeon for surgical evaluation.
3- Preferential request for MRI and electromyogram.
4- Preferential referral to traumatology outpatients.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
In this case we describe a case of cervicobrachialgia without alarm signs at the present time, so the most indicated treatment at this time would be conservative, based on NSAIDs, local heat and rest. This is not an urgent case, so answer 2 would not be valid. The performance of an MRI and an electromyogram are valid options for the etiological study of the picture, however, it is necessary to emphasize that we should first perform a correct pain management, so since we are asked about the first attitude, option 1 would be more valid.
