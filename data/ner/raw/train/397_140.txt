QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY AND ORTHOPEDICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
You assess a 66-year-old patient with accentuated groin pain with prolonged standing a few days a month. A plain radiograph of the hips shows narrowing of the femoroacetabular joint space, sclerosis and osteophytes. What is your attitude?
1- I make the diagnosis of coxarthrosis and send to the traumatologist to place a hip prosthesis.
2- Start treatment with weak opioids that have shown evidence of halting disease progression.
3- I instigate treatment with paracetamol, explain that the evolution is very variable and the surgical indication depends on functionality and pain control.
4- Because of the radiological features described, I need a hip MRI before making a therapeutic decision.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
You present with coxarthrosis (no further imaging tests are needed), and conservative options are exhausted before opting for surgical treatment. Weak opioids are not the initial treatment of choice.
