QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 4-year-old boy consulted for the appearance over the last three days of skin lesions on the legs and buttocks. His parents reported that his pediatrician had diagnosed an upper respiratory tract infection 10 days earlier. In the last 12 hours she presented intense colicky abdominal pain and had two diarrheal stools. Afebrile. No weight loss. On examination she has numerous petechiae and palpable purpuric lesions predominantly on the buttocks and lower extremities. Good general condition although she has intense abdominal pain. Abdominal palpation is difficult to assess due to diffuse pain. No visceromegaly. No other findings of interest on examination. Which of the following data does NOT support your diagnostic suspicion?
1- Knee and ankle arthritis.
2- Hematuria.
3- Plateletopenia.
4- Fecal occult blood.
5- Scrotal edema.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
You are describing a Schönlein-Henoch purpura which is a vasculitic phenomenon, so the lesions are not due to plateletopenia. Scrotal edema (sometimes even torsion of Morgani's capsid of the testis) is not exceptional in males with S. Schönlein-Henoch.
