T1	Premise 55 141	A 25-year-old patient, during a tennis match, has severe pain in his neck and left eye
T2	Premise 143 312	The next morning he wakes up with a feeling of gait instability and has palpebral ptosis of the left eye and anisocoria, with the left pupil being smaller than the right
T3	Premise 314 354	The patient maintains good visual acuity
T4	Claim 406 423	III cranial nerve
T5	Claim 428 440	Optic chiasm
T6	Marker 384 390	locate
T7	Claim 445 468	Upper cervical ganglion
T8	Claim 473 484	Spinal cord
T9	Claim 511 580	Claude-Bernard-Horner syndrome is an old acquaintance of the MIR exam
T10	Claim 657 717	Characteristic is upper eyelid ptosis and miosis of that eye
R1	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T10	
T11	Claim 719 799	This occurs due to a deficit of sympathetic innervation of the orbital territory
T12	Claim 801 925	The sympathetic nervous system innervates the Müller muscle, which is an accessory muscle to the levator of the upper eyelid
T13	Claim 927 989	If the Müller ceases to function, the eyelid descends slightly
T14	Claim 991 1033	It also innervates the iris dilator muscle
T15	Marker 994 998	also
T16	Claim 1035 1146	Therefore, the sphincter muscle, its antagonist, is unopposed and the balance of the pupil shifts toward miosis
T17	Marker 1035 1044	Therefore
T18	Claim 1148 1193	It explains ptosis and miosis of the left eye
T19	Claim 1195 1229	so we suspect Horner's in that eye
T20	Marker 1195 1197	so

T22	Premise 1231 1361	She also describes what may have happened: after a possible sudden movement while playing tennis, she has neck pain and a Horner's
T23	Claim 1363 1392	We should suspect an aneurysm
R9	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T23	
T24	Claim 1394 1532	We should suspect a dissecting carotid aneurysm, which is one of the best known (and most serious) causes of an acquired Horner's syndrome
R10	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T24	
T25	Claim 1534 1696	The superior cervical ganglion is a ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system located in the sheath of the carotid artery, and at this level it has been affected

T26	Claim 1754 1811	An alteration of the III cranial nerve can produce ptosis
T27	Claim 1813 1863	but the pupil, if affected, should be in mydriasis
T28	Claim 1865 1966	And damage to the third cranial nerve should also produce some type of ophthalmoplegia, with diplopia
R14	Attack Ent1:T27 Ent2:T26	
T29	Marker 1813 1816	but
R15	Attack Ent1:T2 Ent2:T27

R18	Attack Ent1:T3 Ent2:T28	
R19	Attack Ent1:T2 Ent2:T28	
T30	Claim 1968 2079	An involvement of the optic chiasm would produce a bilateral loss of vision (probably a bitemporal hemianopsia)
T31	Premise 2081 2146	We are told in the statement that he maintains good visual acuity
R20	Attack Ent1:T31 Ent2:T30	
R21	Attack Ent1:T30 Ent2:T5	
T32	Claim 2148 2210	On the other hand, there would also be no ptosis or anisocoria
T33	Marker 2148 2165	On the other hand
R22	Attack Ent1:T32 Ent2:T5	
R23	Attack Ent1:T2 Ent2:T32	
T34	Claim 2212 2476	And finally, an alteration of the medulla oblongata would produce different neurological symptoms not described, and there should be no ptosis or pupillary alterations, because the third pair is located in the midbrain and the sympathetic nuclei in the spinal cord
