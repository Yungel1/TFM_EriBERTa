QUESTION TYPE: INFECTOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 17-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a high fever, pharyngeal pain and cervical lymphadenopathy. She had previously been diagnosed with acute pharyngitis and was treated with amoxicillin, and later presented with a generalized macular skin rash. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and presence of activated lymphocytes, slight thrombopenia and slightly increased transaminases. What would be the most likely diagnosis of this clinical picture?
1- It is a typical picture of infectious mononucleosis.
2- Varicella zoster virus infection.
3- Acute toxoplasmosis.
4- Lyme disease.
5- Infection by herpes virus 8.
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Of course it is a typical picture (EBV, CMV, VH6, Toxoplasma), of which you will not see so clearly at the emergency room door when you are on call. Be careful with the bad blood in answer 3, because an acute toxoplasmosis can behave like this and also give a macular exanthema, although the one of this girl is related to the intake of amoxicillin. By the way, I add a note, if instead of a girl of 17 years so clear it were a young man/girl with risky sexual relations, do not forget the HIV primoinfection as a cause of mononucleosis syndrome.
