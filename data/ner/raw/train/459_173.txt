QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY AND ORTHOPEDICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 36-year-old man with no past history of interest who, after a high-energy trauma following a fall from a motorcycle, presents with a Gustilo grade II open midshaft fracture of the tibia. Which of the following maneuvers or therapies is most effective for preventing infection?
1- Immediate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
2- Exhaustive debridement-wound lavage in the operating room with at least 10 liters of saline.
3- Urgent stabilization of the fracture by external fixation and early wound closure.
4- Early wound closure with antiseptics and oxygen therapy at two liters per minute.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
I believe that the most correct is 2, since Gustilo II fractures are mainly covered with Gram (+) by means of a 1st generation Cepha, and it is not a question of prevention but of treatment (it is considered to be contaminated).
