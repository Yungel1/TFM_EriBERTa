T1	Premise 58 314	A 64-year-old man, diagnosed with myasthenia gravis 1 year ago, treated with low-dose steroids (3 mg/day of deflazacort) and anticholinesterase drugs, asymptomatic for 6 months, consults for mild difficulty in swallowing and evening diplopia for a few days
T2	Premise 316 379	He was admitted to the hospital for suspected myasthenic crisis
T3	Premise 407 625	The next day the patient alerts at 03 hours in the morning because the patient makes a strange noise when breathing in, like a soft snoring, the patient is sound asleep and very sweaty, but does not seem to be fatigued
T4	Claim 665 808	Reassure the nurse and family that the patient is a habitual snorer and is peacefully asleep. The patient should be placed in lateral decubitus
T5	Claim 813 942	Notify intensive care for suspected acute respiratory failure, to assess possible orotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation
T6	Claim 947 1001	Perform polysomnographic study to rule out sleep apnea
T7	Claim 1006 1073	Decrease steroid dose; if he has a steroid myopathy he will improve
T8	Claim 1078 1178	Order a thoracic CT scan to rule out compressive thymoma over the trachea associated with myasthenia
T9	Claim 1198 1331	This is a patient with decompensated myasthenia with bulbar symptoms (dysphagia) and therefore risk of respiratory muscle involvement

R2	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T9	
T10	Premise 1333 1557	The respiratory symptoms correspond to an exhaustion of the muscles, first inspiratory and then accessory (the patient does not appear fatigued or tachypneic because the muscles are exhausted), progressing to a carbonic coma
