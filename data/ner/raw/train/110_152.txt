QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
Patient 76 years old, parity 3-0-3-1, with menopause at age 52. She reports that for at least 4-5 years she has had vulvar pruritus of variable intensity which has been treated sometimes with self-medication and other times on the advice of her general practitioner with topical preparations (creams and washes). The pruritus has evolved intermittently, but for the last 3-4 months she has also noticed a small lump on the left labium majus of the vulva, which has been leaking serohaematically on rubbing for a few days; she therefore consulted a gynecologist. On questioning, she reports occasional dysuria and her general condition is good. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
1- Genital herpes.
2- Paget's disease of the vulva.
3- Urethral caruncle.
4- Chronic granuloma of the vulva.
5- Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
The correct answer is 5. Vulvar carcinoma is characterized by chronic vulvar itching resistant to multiple treatments, appearance of lumpiness or ulceration, dysuria and urinary urgency, and late pain and bleeding.
