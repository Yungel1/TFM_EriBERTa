T1	Premise 45 221	a 60-year-old diabetic patient with stable angina secondary to ischemic heart disease due to subtotal obstruction in the middle third of the anterior descending coronary artery
T2	Marker 131 137	due to
T3	Claim 260 319	Medical with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina
T4	Claim 324 420	Expectorant with rigorous rest, since decreasing myocardial oxygen demand should decrease angina
T5	Claim 425 572	Surgical revascularization of the ischemic myocardium by means of a left mammary artery bypass distal to the lesion in the diseased coronary artery
T6	Claim 577 648	Dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization
T7	Claim 653 772	Therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area
T8	Claim 1253 1295	2 is absurd: sitting down to avoid angina?
R1	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T4	
T9	Claim 1064 1093	Answer 1 is along these lines
T10	Premise 1095 1251	although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly)
T11	Marker 1095 1103	although
R2	Attack Ent1:T10 Ent2:T9	
R3	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T3	
R4	Attack Ent1:T10 Ent2:T3	
T12	Treatment 1111 1118	statins
T13	Treatment 1120 1134	ACE inhibitors
T14	Treatment 1180 1192	vasodilators
T15	Treatment 1139 1158	antiplatelet agents
T16	Claim 1296 1348	That's like cutting down the forest to prevent fires
R5	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T8	
T17	Claim 1350 1485	3 to 5 are about revascularization: since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous
T18	Claim 1490 1502	we discard 3
T19	Marker 1487 1489	so
R6	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T18	
R7	Attack Ent1:T18 Ent2:T5	
T20	Treatment 1367 1384	revascularization
T21	Claim 1504 1547	Between 4 and 5, the fifth is more complete
R8	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T7	
T22	Premise 792 818	Stable angina in diabetics
T23	Premise 1549 1618	not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent
R9	Support Ent1:T23 Ent2:T21	
T24	Claim 1620 1657	So the doubt would be between 1 and 5
T25	Claim 2061 2119	I would mark 5... but I would not be surprised if it was 1
T26	Premise 1659 1790	Applying the general rules of response in the MIR, if two options are similar except in one detail, the correct one is one of these
T27	Claim 1795 1810	we would mark 5
T28	Premise 1812 1909	and this is what would be done in any hospital nowadays: a suboccluded artery is dilated directly
R10	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T27	
R11	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T27	
R12	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T7	
R13	Attack Ent1:T21 Ent2:T6	
T29	Marker 1386 1391	since
T30	Treatment 273 285	vasodilators
T31	Treatment 290 303	beta-blockers
T32	Disease 313 319	angina
T33	Marker 356 361	since
T34	Disease 414 420	angina
T35	Treatment 324 335	Expectorant
T36	Treatment 425 572	Surgical revascularization of the ischemic myocardium by means of a left mammary artery bypass distal to the lesion in the diseased coronary artery
T37	Treatment 577 648	Dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization
T38	Treatment 653 724	Therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery
T39	Treatment 729 772	implantation of a stent in the dilated area
R14	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T7
