CORRECT ANSWER: 1
A middle-aged woman with Sjögren's-like symptoms (absence of lacrimation, dry mouth), with hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, makes us think of primary biliary cirrhosis. To diagnose it we will use antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA IgG). Therefore, it would be answer 1.
