T10	Premise 311 395	Gastrointestinal endoscopy: small sliding hiatal hernia with no signs of esophagitis
T11	Treatment 435 455	Administer oral iron

T17	Diagnostics 650 674	gynecological evaluation
T18	Claim 694 768	We have a case of chronic iron deficiency anemia, without obvious bleeding
T19	Claim 770 850	The first cause of iron deficiency anemia is occult bleeding of digestive origin
T20	Claim 852 991	The existence of clinical symptoms suggestive of pathology of the upper digestive tract has led us to begin the study with upper endoscopy,
T21	Marker 992 995	but
T22	Claim 996 1039	there is no pathology to justify the anemia
T23	Marker 1041 1043	so
T24	Claim 1044 1111	further investigation is necessary, which rules out answers 1 and 2
