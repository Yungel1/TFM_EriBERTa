T1	Premise 63 205	A 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension treated with amlodipine was admitted 3 months ago for heart failure and atrial fibrillation
T2	Premise 261 465	The discharge report shows the result of the echocardiogram showing moderate left ventricular dysfunction and the discharge treatment: amlodipine was discontinued and furosemide and enalapril were started
T3	Premise 467 542	The patient reports feeling better, without fatigue and with less leg edema
T4	Marker 544 547	but
T5	Premise 548 580	she is still not completely well
T6	Premise 719 767	The ECG shows atrial fibrillation at 110-120 bpm
T7	Premise 582 635	Physical examination showed no signs of heart failure
T8	Marker 637 640	but
T9	Premise 641 717	her blood pressure and heart rate were 150/90 mmHg and 120 bpm, respectively
T10	Claim 872 904	Digoxin and acetylsalicylic acid
T11	Claim 909 942	Atenolol and acetylsalicylic acid
T12	Claim 947 973	Verapamil and acenocoumaro
T13	Claim 979 1007	Carvedilol and acenocoumarol
T14	Claim 1012 1038	Carvedilol and clopidogrel
T15	Treatment 872 879	Digoxin
T16	Treatment 884 904	acetylsalicylic acid
T17	Treatment 909 917	Atenolol
T18	Treatment 922 942	acetylsalicylic acid
T19	Treatment 947 956	Verapamil
T20	Treatment 961 974	acenocoumarol
T21	Treatment 979 989	Carvedilol
T22	Treatment 994 1007	acenocoumarol
T23	Treatment 1012 1022	Carvedilol
T24	Treatment 1027 1038	clopidogrel
T25	Premise 1132 1239	The patient is in heart failure with moderate ventricular dysfunction and also presents atrial fibrillation
T26	Premise 1241 1277	she has criteria for anticoagulation
T27	Claim 1283 1368	between the two options that include acenocoumarol we are inclined to choose option 4
R1	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T27	
T28	Claim 1376 1464	it includes carvedilol, a drug that has been shown to increase survival in heart failure
T29	Marker 1370 1375	since
R2	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T27	
R3	Support Ent1:T27 Ent2:T13	
T30	Claim 1466 1802	Verapamil (and calcium antagonists in general) are contraindicated in systolic heart failure: they do not increase survival (they even increase morbidity and mortality) and specifically the non-dihydropyridines (verapamil and diltiazem) should not be associated with beta-blockers due to the increased risk of conduction system blockade
