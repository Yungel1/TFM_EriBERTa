QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
Child 28 days old, born at term. History of normal pregnancy and delivery. He has been breastfed since birth. He consults because 8 days ago he started vomiting, initially sporadically and since 5 days ago, after all feedings. He is permanently hungry. The vomiting is of "squirting" food content. On palpation, the abdomen is soft and depressible, without visceromegaly. The blood gas analysis showed pH 7.49, bicarbonate 30 mEq/l, pCO2 53 mmHg, base excess +8 mEq/l. Ions: Na 137 mEq/l, K 3.1 mEq/l, Cl 94 mEq/l. Taking into account the most probable diagnosis in the clinical picture described, what is the complementary test of choice to confirm this clinical diagnosis?
1- Simple abdominal X-ray.
2- pHmetry.
3- Abdominal ultrasound.
4- Determination of electrolytes in sweat.
5- Esophagogastroscopy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The correct answer is 3. Easy question if pathology is suspected, which I also think is simple because the clinical description is textbook hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
