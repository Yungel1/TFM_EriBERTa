CORRECT ANSWER: 2
In a polytraumatized patient, the first cause of shock is blood loss (hemorrhagic shock). The guidelines to follow should always contemplate the replenishment of blood volume (if possible, with blood products as early as possible) and control of the focus. In this case, given the vital compromise, the need for transfusion is very urgent, so the indication is emergency blood transfusion (O Rh negative).
