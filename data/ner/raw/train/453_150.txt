QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 25-year-old man consults for tremor. Examination reveals dysarthria and dystonia. He has a family history of psychiatric illness and movement disorders. Which diagnostic test do you consider most accurate?
1- DATS CAN.
2- Nerve conduction study.
3- Electroencephalogram.
4- Copper in urine of 24.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
If they are talking about a young man 20-30 years old, with tremor and dystonia, whether or not he has a family history, and especially if one of the options tells me about copper in urine, they are telling me to think of Wilson's disease. I do not think of juvenile Parkinson's, nor an epileptic clinic. So the correct answer is 4.
