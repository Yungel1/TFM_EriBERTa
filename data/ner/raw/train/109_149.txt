QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 32-year-old asymptomatic woman goes for a gynecological health check-up because she wishes to become pregnant. During this check-up, a 4cm uterine myoma is detected, partly intramural and partly subserosal, located on the anterior aspect of the uterus and which does not deform the endometrial cavity. What approach would you recommend?
1- Laparoscopic myomectomy.
2- Laparotomic myomectomy.
3- Myoma embolization by arterial catheterization.
4- Treatment with Gn-Rh analogues for three months before attempting pregnancy.
5- Attempting pregnancy without any previous treatment.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
The correct answer is 5. An asymptomatic myoma of this size that does not deform the endometrial cavity is not a problem for pregnancy.
