T1	Premise 45 118	Elizabeth has three sons and one daughter (Mary), all of whom are healthy
T2	Premise 120 216	A brother and a maternal uncle of Isabel died of Duchenne disease: an X-linked recessive disease
T3	Premise 218 332	At present, Maria wants to become pregnant and wants to know the risk of transmitting the disease to her offspring
T4	Claim 431 434	2/3
T5	Claim 439 442	1/2
T6	Premise 367 426	the probability that Maria is a carrier of Duchenne disease
T7	Claim 447 450	1/4
T8	Claim 455 468	Less than 1/4
T9	Premise 495 583	The maternal grandmother carried the mutation in one copy of the gene on an X chromosome
T10	Premise 585 691	we are not told that she had the disease, but a son of hers, Isabel's maternal uncle, did have the disease
T11	Claim 694 731	Isabel's mother continues to carry it
T12	Premise 739 812	one of Isabel's brothers has suffered from the disease but not her father
T13	Marker 733 738	since
R1	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T11	
R2	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T11	
T14	Claim 814 896	Thus, Isabel has a 50% chance of having inherited the mutated gene from her mother
T15	Marker 814 818	Thus
T16	Premise 901 929	her children are all healthy
T17	Marker 898 900	as
T18	Claim 931 966	we are not sure if she is a carrier
R3	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T18	
T19	Claim 973 1070	therefore her daughter has a 25% chance of having inherited the mutated gene from her grandmother
R4	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T19	
R5	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T7	
T20	Marker 973 982	therefore
