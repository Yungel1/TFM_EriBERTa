QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 55-year-old male who suffers a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm. He is treated surgically. After a good evolution in which he recovers the ability to walk, one month after suffering the hemorrhage, he presents a progressive deterioration, becoming cloudy and with difficulty to obey orders. Mark the correct statement:
1- She is in the moment of evolution in which vasospasm is more frequent.
2- This progressive deterioration is probably secondary to aneurysm rebleeding.
3- Subacute deterioration is most likely due to hydrocephalus.
4- The diagnostic technique of choice is cerebral angiography.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Vasospasm as a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs early, in the week after the hemorrhage. The progressive deterioration with alteration of the level of consciousness makes us suspect one of the complications that can occur in this condition: hydrocephalus. The diagnostic technique of choice in this case is neuroimaging with cranial CT.
