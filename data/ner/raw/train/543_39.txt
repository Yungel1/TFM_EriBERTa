CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Anisakis simplex is a parasite frequently found in fish. To avoid reactions with this parasite, a diet free of fresh and raw fish (anchovies in vinegar, smoked, salted fish, sushi, etc.) should be followed. Deep-frozen fish or fresh fish previously frozen at -20ºC for at least 5 days before cooking can be consumed, as long as it is cooked at high temperatures >60ºC (roasted, fried, etc.), avoiding raw, grilled or microwaved preparations. It is recommended to consume preferably the tails because the larvae of the parasite are usually close to the viscera of the head.
