QUESTION TYPE: ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 70-year-old man consults for non-radiating lumbar pain of 1 week's duration, of progressive intensity, accompanied by marked limitation of spinal mobility and febrile fever. The lumbar spine X-ray shows no alterations. What diagnosis should we rule out first and with what technique?
1- Vertebral crush with computed tomography (CT).
2- Bone metastases with technetium bone scan.
3- Vertebral ankylosing hyperostosis with dorsolumbar spine x-ray.
4- Pyogenic spondylodiscitis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
We suspect spondylodiscitis - the febrile fever and the limitation of mobility of the spine with the acute course give the key -, and the indicated test is the MRI. "The most demonstrative test is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is positive even in the first 2 weeks of the picture, which facilitates early diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 90%". Vertebral crushing would be seen in the simple X-ray, as well as vertebral ankylosing hyperostosis and many metastases. In addition, there is no data in the history pointing to bone metastases (oncologic history, weight loss etc).
