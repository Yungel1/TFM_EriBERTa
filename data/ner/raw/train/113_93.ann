T17	Premise 825 851	With the data we are given
T18	Claim 853 1090	the first thing that comes to mind is that it is an arregenerative anemia, since the bone marrow has not responded with an exaltation of erythropoiesis; in this way we have already eliminated the options that speak of regenerative anemia

T20	Claim 1092 1390	The next thing that orients us towards the cause is that it is microcytic and hypochromic, which is characteristic of iron deficiency anemia, since folic deficiency gives rise to megaloblastic anemia and active hemorrhage does not give microcytosis or hypochromia, but normocytosis and normochromia

T25	Claim 1392 1687	We are almost inclined to answer 5, central arregenerative anemia due to iron deficiency...but there remains answer 1, "thalassemic trait", which makes us uncomfortable and makes us doubt if we are not going for the apparently easy thing...until we remember that in thalassemia the ADE is normal
