QUESTION TYPE: CRITICAL CARE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 72-year-old man presenting since 48 hours with fever of 38.7°C, cough, purulent expectoration and dyspnea. Constants: BP 85/60 mmHg, heart rate 100 bpm, respiratory rate 35 rpm, SatO2 80%. Of note was the presence of confusion and crackles in the left lower lung field. Chest X-ray confirms the existence of pneumonia of the lingula and left lower lobe. What would be the appropriate place of care?
1- Outpatient treatment at home.
2- Admission to an emergency observation unit.
3- Hospital admission to the ward.
4- Admission to the Intensive Care Unit.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Applying the CURB-65 severity scale (one of the most commonly used in the ED for stratifying the severity of pneumonia, although in this case simply applying common sense, the patient should be admitted to the ICU), we would have a score of at least 4 points (we would be missing the serum urea data), which gives us severity criteria. Since there are no criteria that contraindicate admission to the ICU, admission to the unit would be indicated.
