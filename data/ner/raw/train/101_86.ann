T24	Disease 1106 1126	hungry bone syndrome
T26	Claim 1410 1658	This syndrome can be observed after surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as in tertiary HPT of chronic renal failure, and to a lesser extent after treatment of processes with excess of circulating thyroid hormones (2)
T27	Claim 1660 1841	In PTH, there is an excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which stimulates osteoclastic activity causing demineralization of the bone matrix and releasing calcium into the bloodstream

T38	Treatment 1849 1867	parathyroidectomy,
T28	Claim 1843 2072	After parathyroidectomy, serum PTH levels drop dramatically, thus, PTH-induced bone resorption ceases, while osteoblastic activity continues resulting in increased bone uptake of calcium, phosphate and magnesium, thus SHH appears
R7	Support Ent1:T28 Ent2:T16	
T25	Claim 1204 1404	"The pathophysiology of the hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is related to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, which is associated with hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia
