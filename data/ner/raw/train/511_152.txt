QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 79-year-old hypertensive woman on treatment with olmesartan comes for consultation for watery diarrhea of 4 to 6 stools per day for the past two months. Three months ago she was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for 3 weeks for lumbosciatica. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed, both without macroscopic alterations. Duodenal biopsies were normal, while colon biopsies showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria with an irregular band of collagen immediately below the mucosal surface epithelium with a thickness greater than 10 mm and a number of intraepithelial lymphocytes >20 per 100 epithelial cells. Which is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Microscopic colitis.
2- Enteropathy due to NSAIDs.
3- Olmesartan-associated enteropathy.
4- Irritable bowel syndrome.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
The diagnostic criteria for microscopic colitis are: a)Chronic or intermittent non-bloody watery diarrhea b)Colonic mucosa assessed by colonoscopy macroscopically normal or near normal c)Characteristic histopathological findings. In our case, the patient presents findings compatible with collagenous colitis (band of collagen underlying the epithelium greater than 10 microns) and lymphocytic (more than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes). The treatment of this pathology is topical corticosteroids with low oral bioavailability (mainly budesonide). Olmesartan enteropathy produces a picture similar to celiac disease and is characterized by duodenal biopsy with villous atrophy, mucosal inflammation with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and cryptitis. In this case a normal duodenal biopsy is described, but it would be interesting to keep the concept for future examinations.
