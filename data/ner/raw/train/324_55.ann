T1	Premise 71 237	A 70-year-old female patient is admitted to the ICU after suffering anterior AMI treated by coronary angioplasty and stent placement in the anterior descending artery
T2	Premise 239 424	Four days later, she suddenly presents hypotension that requires vigorous volume support, initiation of vasoactive drugs, orotracheal intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation
T3	Premise 426 487	Physical examination revealed a murmur not previously present
T4	Premise 489 603	Suspecting a mechanical complication of the infarction, transthoracic echocardiography showed pericardial effusion
T5	Claim 633 672	Mortality with medical treatment is 20%
T6	Claim 677 789	In case of free wall rupture, there is an oxymetric jump in the right ventricle in the Swan-Ganz catheterization
T7	Claim 794 852	In case of free wall rupture, there is no palpable frémito
T8	Claim 857 929	Mechanical complications usually appear on the first post-infarction day
T9	Claim 956 979	Mortality is not so low
R1	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T5	
T10	Claim 981 1057	the oximetric jump occurs in the case of septum rupture, as well as fremitus
T11	Claim 1059 1088	hence the correct answer is 3
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T7	
R2	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T7	
T12	Claim 1094 1138	complications can occur up to the first week
R3	Attack Ent1:T10 Ent2:T6	
R5	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T8	
T13	Marker 1059 1064	hence
