QUESTION TYPE: CARDIOLOGY AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 70-year-old woman, hypertensive and diabetic, who has worked as a sales clerk all her life. She consults for an internal malleolar lesion in the right leg with intense pain throughout the day that worsens at night. On examination, there are uncomplicated varicose cords in both extremities and normal femoral and popliteal pulses with absence of distal pulses. What examination should we perform first?
1- Venous echo-Doppler of lower limbs.
2- Angioresonance of lower limbs.
3- Arteriography.
4- Ankle-brachial index.
5- AngioCT.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
At least for me, as a family physician, I usually start with the least invasive and most cost-effective tests, and in the case described, an ischemic problem in the lower limbs is the ankle-brachial index.
