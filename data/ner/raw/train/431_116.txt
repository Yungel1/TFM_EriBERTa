Laboratory tests showed creatinine 3.4 mg/dL, AST 764 UlL, ALT 678 UlL. The laboratory reports the visualization of Plasmodium falciparum in the blood with a parasitemia level of 6%.

CORRECT ANSWER: 2
In severe cases of Plasmodium infection, the greatest risk of mortality occurs in the first 24 hours of clinical presentation, so treatment should be started immediately. Treatment with parenteral or intramuscular artesunate is more indicated in severe Plasmodium infection, both in adults and children and in pregnant women.
