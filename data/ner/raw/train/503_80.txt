QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 8-year-old boy consults for the appearance of pubic hair at the base of the penis for the last 12 months. The testicle has not increased in volume and the penis has not increased in size. There is no increase in growth rate in the last year. The bone age is one year older than the chronological age. What is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Central precocious puberty.
2- Peripheral precocious puberty.
3- Early adrenarche.
4- Adrenal tumor.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
In the male, the onset of puberty is considered normal from the age of 9 years, therefore in this case it is a premature puberty. The onset of puberty is defined as an increase in testicular volume (greater than or equal to 4cc); by specifying that the testicular size has not increased, we can rule out options 1 and 2. The excessive secretion of androgens produced by an adrenal tumor would cause a greater amount of hair and an increase in penile size, which our patient does not present. Therefore, the correct option is early adrenarche.
