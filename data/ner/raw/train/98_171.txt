QUESTION TYPE: DERMATOLOGY, VENEREOLOGY AND PLASTIC SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
The patient presents since 2 weeks ago a pruritic eruption consisting of multiple polygonal erythematous-violaceous papules, with flattened surface, preferentially located on the anterior aspect of the wrists, pretibial area and lumbar area. She also presents whitish reticulated lesions in the jugal mucosa. What is the most probable diagnosis?
1- Pityriasis versicolor.
2- Mycosis fungoides.
3- Psoriasis in drops.
4- Pityriasis rosea of Gibert.
5- Lichen planus.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
Lichen planus is a very common dermatosis of unknown etiology characterized by the appearance of pruritic polygonal papules, with a purplish color and shiny surface, preferentially located in the distal areas of the extremities. Characteristically these papules show a symmetrical distribution and are preferentially located on the anterior aspect of the wrists (Figure 1) and ankles. Oral mucosal involvement is very frequent, and approximately 75% of patients with lichen planus show an asymptomatic whitish reticulation affecting the jugal or lingual mucosa.
