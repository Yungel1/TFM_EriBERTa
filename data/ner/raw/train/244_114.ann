T1	Premise 51 266	A 16-year-old boy consults for presenting with pustular tonsillitis, fever up to 38.5°C, painful cervical lymphadenopathy, non-pruritic macular rash on the chest and mild hepatosplenomegaly, of 4-5 days of evolution
T2	Premise 268 330	Paul-Bunnell test and Ig M for Epstein-Barr virus are positive
T3	Premise 332 468	During his admission he developed continuous fever up to 40ºC, pancytopenia, icteric hepatitis and coagulopathy of progressive intensity
T4	Premise 470 566	One week after admission, he was transferred to the ICU due to confusion and respiratory failure
T5	Premise 568 616	Blood cultures and a urine culture were negative
T6	Premise 618 674	CSF was normal and the chest x-ray showed no infiltrates
T7	Premise 676 699	Procalcitonin is normal
T8	Premise 705 739	CRP and ferritin are very elevated
T9	Marker 701 704	but
T10	Claim 842 943	She has a bacterial sepsis of undetermined origin and should be given ceftriaxone and supportive care
T11	Claim 948 1059	She has bacterial sepsis of undetermined origin and should be given vancomycin, ceftacidime and supportive care
T12	Claim 1064 1160	This is infectious mononucleosis with a severe course and glucocorticoids should be administered
T13	Claim 1165 1266	This is an infectious mononucleosis of severe course and treatment with Acyclovir should be initiated
T14	Claim 1271 1398	I would perform a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate and, if hemophagocytosis is confirmed, initiate treatment with immunosuppressants
T15	Premise 1496 1649	The patient is a 16-year-old male who is admitted for a fairly clear case of mononucleosis due to EBV infection that becomes complicated during admission
T16	Disease 1573 1586	mononucleosis
T17	Marker 1587 1593	due to
T18	Disease 1594 1607	EBV infection
T19	Premise 1651 1726	The data available to us are: - Pancytopenia. - Hepatopathy. - Coagulopathy
T20	Premise 1730 1833	Absence of infectious focus: negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, normal X-ray, normal CSF
T21	Premise 1837 1885	CRP and Ferritin elevated / normal Procalcitonin
T22	Claim 1887 2026	The possible complications that could have occurred (and that are considered in the answers) are sepsis or a bad evolution of mononucleosis
T23	Premise 2098 2153	the main infectious foci have been reasonably ruled out
T24	Premise 2158 2257	one of the most sensitive and specific markers of bacteremia (procalcitonin) is in the normal range
T25	Marker 2089 2096	however
T26	Claim 2259 2290	which should draw our attention
T27	Claim 2028 2087	The clinical data could be consistent with a septic process

T29	Claim 2292 2394	On the other hand, a complication of the EBV mononucleosis suffered by our patient should be evaluated
T30	Claim 2396 2528	among the possible complications are hemolytic anemia, meningoecephalitis (normal CSF) or Guillain-Barré sd. Guillain-Barré syndrome
T31	Premise 2530 2601	which are not very consistent with the clinical picture presented to us
R9	Attack Ent1:T31 Ent2:T30	
T32	Claim 2603 2689	Another possible complication of exceptional severity would be hemophagocytic syndrome
T33	Claim 2691 2902	this is a rare entity that occurs in certain predisposed subjects and is characterized by an uncontrolled activation and proliferation of histiocytes and T lymphocytes, which produces a state of hypercytokinemia
T34	Claim 2905 3073	The diagnostic criteria, revised in 2004, include persistent high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia
R10	Support Ent1:T33 Ent2:T32	
R11	Support Ent1:T34 Ent2:T32	
T35	Claim 3075 3284	Hyperferritinemia >3000 in a suggestive clinical context necessitates treatment of the patient (mainly with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids) since mortality is very high and early treatment is essential
T36	Claim 3286 3355	The definitive diagnosis is made by microscopic study of an OM biopsy
R12	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T34	
T37	Claim 3358 3595	Although in this question they do not quantify the value of ferritinemia, it is a remarkable data and given that the clinical picture is suggestive, meeting the diagnostic criteria, it seems to me that answer 5 would be the most accurate
