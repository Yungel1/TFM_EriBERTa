QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND MICROBIOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 85-year-old man with a peripheral venous catheter who, one week after being hospitalized for a stroke, begins with shivering and fever. Blood cultures are performed and microbiology reports that gram-positive cocci are growing in clusters. Pending the antibiogram, what is the most appropriate antibiotic treatment?
1- Cefazolin.
2- Cloxacillin.
3- Vancomycin.
4- Linezolid.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
The most frequent cause of catheter infection is a bacterium that colonizes the skin. The Gram stain tells us that it is a staphylococcus, most of the species of this genus acquired in-hospital are methicillin resistant, so they are considered resistant to Cloxacillin, Cefazolin and there are no clinical data about the efficacy of linezolid for the treatment of systemic infection related to catheter. This, plus the experience with vancomycin use in this setting is considered the empirical choice for vancomycin.
