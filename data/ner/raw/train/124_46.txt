QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 58-year-old woman comes for a follow-up visit for diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She feels well but states that she has stopped taking verapamil because of constipation. She presents with intolerance to ACE inhibitors due to coughing. On examination, blood pressure is 156/92 mm Hg. CBC includes a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, 24-hour urine protein excretion of 1.5 g/day, and a creatinine clearance of 45 ml/min. On this basis, what is the most effective treatment to slow the progression of the patient's type 2 diabetic nephropathy?
1- Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.
2- Angiotensin receptor blocker.
3- Calcium antagonist.
4- Alpha-blocker.
5- Beta-blocker.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
This question is typical and quite easy. The antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy are the ACE inhibitors and ARAIIs. Specifically, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated their efficacy in this field for type 2 DM, which together with the side effects that IECAS produce in the patient makes an ARAII the drug of choice. This does not seem to me to be an open question (without going into pharmacoeconomic issues, of course...).
