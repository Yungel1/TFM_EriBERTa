T1	Premise 55 180	A man has a partial deletion in the dystrophin gene (chromosome Xp21) which causes the semiology of Becker muscular dystrophy
T2	Disease 155 180	Becker muscular dystrophy
T3	Premise 182 283	He goes to the genetic consultation with his wife, to assess the risks of transmission of the disease
T4	Claim 371 494	According to autosomal dominant inheritance, half of her children will inherit the disease and without distinction of sexes
T5	Claim 499 624	Their daughters will not inherit the disease, but all their future sons will be carriers and can transmit the mutation to 50%
T6	Claim 629 754	Their sons will not inherit the disease, but all their future daughters will be carriers and can transmit the mutation to 50%
T7	Claim 759 864	There is no risk: the inheritance of the disease is of the mitochondrial type, never transmitted by males
T8	Claim 869 994	According to autosomal recessive inheritance, 25% of their children will manifest the disease in childhood, regardless of sex
T9	Claim 1014 1129	It is the male who presents the disease, which we are told is X-linked, so there are only two options left: 2 and 3
T10	Marker 1086 1088	so
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T5	
R2	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T6	
T11	Claim 1131 1316	2 is not because the males will receive the Y chromosome from the father and the X from the mother, who is healthy, so the daughters will be able to carry the disease (correct option 3)
T12	Marker 1140 1147	because
T13	Marker 1247 1249	so
R3	Attack Ent1:T11 Ent2:T5	
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T6
