QUESTION TYPE: ONCOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 60-year-old man comes to the emergency department for a coma crisis. Ex-smoker for 3 years, with no other history of interest. A CT scan shows multiple metastases. What is the most probable origin?
1- Head and neck cancer.
2- Lung cancer.
3- Urinary bladder cancer.
4- Colon cancer.
5- Pancreatic cancer.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Pretty easy, isn't it? Lung cancer is the most frequent cause of brain metastases and in 20-30% of cases it is as a result of them that the primary tumor is diagnosed (as here).
