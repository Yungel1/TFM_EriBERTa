QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 3-year-old girl from Bangladesh consults for intermittent febrile episodes of 3 weeks' duration, associated with weakness and loss of appetite. Physical examination showed marked splenomegaly and mucocutaneous pallor. Complementary tests include: hemoglobin 8.5 mg/dL, hematocrit 26%, MCV 86 fL, MCH 29 pg, leukocytes 2800/mL with 300 neutrophils /ml, platelets 54000/ml, GOT 85 U/l, GPT92 U/l and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia in serum proteinogram. Indicate the most probable diagnosis with the data available at this time:
1- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
2- Burkitt's lymphoma.
3- Visceral leishmaniasis.
4- Miliary tuberculosis.
5- Chronic malaria.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Data such as pancytopenia and hypergammaglobulinemia are very characteristic of kala-azar. The origin of the girl is also indicative of this diagnosis, although it is a disease that also occurs in the Mediterranean area. In the differential diagnosis, it is important to keep in mind the possibility of leukosis.
