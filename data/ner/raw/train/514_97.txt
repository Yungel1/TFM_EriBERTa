QUESTION TYPE: CRITICAL AND EMERGENCY CARE
CLINICAL CASE: 
After a traffic accident you attend to an injured person. The patient opens his eyes at your call, but only utters words that are inappropriate. On motor examination, the pain is localized in the right extremities, but spreads on stimulation of the left extremities. How would you describe his condition according to the Glasgow Coma Scale?
1- E3V2M4.
2- E3V3M5.
3- E2V3M4.
4- E2V4M5.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The first thing we should know when applying the Glasgow Coma Scale to a patient is that we should always keep the best value in each sphere (ocular response, motor response and verbal response). In this case, we have a patient who has an ocular opening to the call (ocular response 3 out of 4), emits inappropriate words (verbal response 3 out of 5) and localizes pain with right extremities (motor response 5 out of 6). The Glasgow Coma Scale score would be 11 (out of 15). The best value of the examination is taken because in many cases (assessment of a polytraumatized patient, ischemic stroke or spontaneous acute cerebral bleeding), the motor examination may be artifacted by other elements. For example: in a polytraumatized patient (such as the one in question), the response presented with left extremities may be due to localized trauma in that area, and not strictly speaking to an underlying traumatic brain injury. Likewise, sometimes the verbal response may be underestimated in the polytraumatized patient due to airway obstruction (e.g., due to the tongue retreating into the oropharynx). By always assessing the best response, we will have a truer picture of the patient's condition.
