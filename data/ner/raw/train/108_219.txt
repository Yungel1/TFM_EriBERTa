QUESTION TYPE: GENETICS AND IMMUNOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A man has a partial deletion in the dystrophin gene (chromosome Xp21) which causes the semiology of Becker muscular dystrophy. He goes to the genetic consultation with his wife, to assess the risks of transmission of the disease. What correct information will be provided in the course of the genetic counseling?
1- According to autosomal dominant inheritance, half of her children will inherit the disease and without distinction of sexes.
2- Their daughters will not inherit the disease, but all their future sons will be carriers and can transmit the mutation to 50%.
3- Their sons will not inherit the disease, but all their future daughters will be carriers and can transmit the mutation to 50%.
4- There is no risk: the inheritance of the disease is of the mitochondrial type, never transmitted by males.
5- According to autosomal recessive inheritance, 25% of their children will manifest the disease in childhood, regardless of sex.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
It is the male who presents the disease, which we are told is X-linked, so there are only two options left: 2 and 3. 2 is not because the males will receive the Y chromosome from the father and the X from the mother, who is healthy, so the daughters will be able to carry the disease (correct option 3).
