T1	Premise 45 128	A 68-year-old woman who uses +4.00 diopter glasses for distance vision in both eyes
T2	Premise 130 282	She consults because she has been having eye pain with headache and blurred vision at night when she is watching television in dim light for a few weeks
T3	Claim 350 382	Primary angular closure glaucoma
T4	Claim 387 395	Migraine
T5	Claim 400 417	Actinic keratitis
T6	Claim 422 438	Dry eye syndrome
T7	Premise 465 515	We are presented with a 68-year-old female patient
T8	Claim 517 654	At that age the crystalline lens, although it does not normally have a cataract that needs surgery, it usually has increased in thickness
T9	Marker 551 559	although
R1	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T8	
T10	Claim 656 748	This implies that it projects the iris forward and reduces the depth of the anterior chamber
R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T10	
T11	Claim 750 826	In an eye with a normal anterior chamber depth this is usually not a problem
T12	Claim 828 888	But farsighted people already have a narrow anterior chamber
T13	Marker 828 831	But
T14	Claim 890 995	This is the usual combination we find in primary angular closure: farsightedness and age over 50-60 years
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T11	
R4	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T12	
R5	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T14	
T15	Claim 997 1051	Younger hyperopes usually do not have this problem yet
R6	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T15	
T16	Claim 1053 1136	And neither do older people who are emmetropic, myopic or have had cataract surgery
T17	Marker 1057 1064	neither
R7	Attack Ent1:T14 Ent2:T16	
T18	Claim 1138 1204	With this narrow angle, what triggers angular closure is mydriasis
T19	Claim 1206 1398	That is, when you are in the penumbra, the pupil dilates and the iris thickens in the peripheral part, where it is already very close to the corneal endothelium in the case of a narrow chamber
R8	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T19	
T20	Claim 1400 1514	Mydriasis then triggers angular closure, which is accompanied by ocular pain that may radiate backwards (headache)
R9	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T20	
T21	Claim 1516 1600	And increased intraocular pressure produces corneal edema that causes blurred vision
R10	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T20	
R11	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T21	
T22	Claim 1602 1632	Therefore, option 1 is correct
T23	Marker 1602 1611	Therefore
R12	Support Ent1:T21 Ent2:T22	
R13	Support Ent1:T22 Ent2:T3	
T24	Disease 350 382	Primary angular closure glaucoma
T25	Claim 1634 1682	Migraine does not have to be related to penumbra
T26	Claim 1688 1746	ocular pain and blurred vision is not particularly typical
R14	Attack Ent1:T25 Ent2:T4	
T27	Disease 387 395	Migraine
R15	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T25	
R16	Support Ent1:T2 Ent2:T26	
T28	Claim 1748 1895	Actinic keratitis is caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation (such as solar radiation), and is not related to hyperopia or to being in penumbra
T29	Disease 1634 1642	Migraine
T30	Claim 1897 1950	In addition, the history of exposure is usually clear
T31	Disease 1748 1765	Actinic keratitis
R17	Support Ent1:T30 Ent2:T28	
R18	Attack Ent1:T28 Ent2:T5	
T32	Disease 400 417	Actinic keratitis
T33	Claim 1952 2085	And finally, dry eye does not produce these symptoms either: it is more a question of burning, foreign body sensation, heaviness, etc
R19	Attack Ent1:T33 Ent2:T6	
T34	Disease 422 438	Dry eye syndrome
T35	Claim 2087 2159	And it is also unrelated to the other elements: penumbra, hyperopia, etc
R20	Support Ent1:T35 Ent2:T33	
T36	Claim 2161 2228	As a minor detail, I would have worded the question a little better
T37	Claim 2230 2347	It is understood that we are asked which pathology is the most probable in relation to the symptoms and the anamnesis
T38	Claim 2349 2459	But as it is worded, we are asked about which of the pathologies she is most likely to present, just like that
T39	Claim 2461 2589	Actually, a 68-year-old woman is very likely to have dry eye, even if it does not cause the symptoms for which she is presenting
