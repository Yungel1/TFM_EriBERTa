T1	Premise 63 168	A 32-year-old man from Cameroon consults for fever cough and left hemithorax pain of 1 month of evolution
T2	Premise 170 248	He took amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 1 week without improvement of symptoms
T3	Premise 250 339	A blood test showed a white blood cell count of 8000/microL and a hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL
T4	Premise 341 430	Chest X-ray shows a loculated left pleural effusion occupying one third of the hemithorax
T5	Premise 432 683	A thoracentesis shows a yellowish fluid with the following features: red blood cells 2000/µL, leukocytes 2500/µL with 90% lymphocytes, protein 4.9 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 550 VIL, glucose 67 mg/dL, and absence of malignant cells on cytologic study
T6	Claim 787 827	A thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan
T7	Claim 832 860	Pleural fluid pH measurement
T8	Claim 865 913	Measurement of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase
T9	Claim 918 933	Tuberculin test
T10	Claim 960 1015	Suspicion is very high for tuberculous pleural effusion
T11	Premise 1020 1128	a young patient from an area with a high rate of TB, a lymphocytic exudate pointing to TB, lymphoma or tumor
R1	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T10	
T12	Disease 987 1015	tuberculous pleural effusion
R2	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T8	
T13	Claim 1130 1174	Tumor unlikely due to age, negative cytology
T14	Claim 1176 1239	Lymphoma could be but no evidence of associated nodal pathology

T17	Claim 1241 1320	High adenosine deaminase in LP would point with great certainty to a pleural TB
R5	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T8	
T18	Claim 1321 1464	although it would be advisable to confirm the diagnosis with a pleural biopsy since it can also occur in lymphomas and empyemas of other origin
