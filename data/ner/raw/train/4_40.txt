QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE
CLINICAL CASE: 
A man presents abruptly with asthenia and jaundice with transaminases above 2000 IU/L. Serological markers show the following pattern: anti-HAV IgM negative, HBsAg negative anti-HBc IgM positive, anti-HCV negative. What is the diagnosis?
1- Chronic hepatitis B.
2- Non-viral acute hepatitis.
3- Acute hepatitis B.
4- D (delta) virus superinfection.
5- Acute hepatitis A and B.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
An interesting one that in general needs to be studied. By the form of presentation, it is clearly an acute hepatitis, so option 1 is ruled out. The negative IgM of HAV rules out 5 and the negative HBs Ag rules out 4 (to have delta virus you need surface antigen B). When having IgM anti HBc we speak of an acute hepatitis B (3), since there is a window period of negativization of the antigen.
