QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 24-year-old woman, primigestation, suffers a spontaneous abortion at 7 weeks of gestation. The anatomopathological study of the abortive remains indicates molar disease. We should inform you that:
1- The risk of a new molar gestation in a future pregnancy is 50%.
2- She should not become pregnant until she has undergone periodic controls and has spent one year with negative BHCG levels.
3- Subsequent controls are not necessary if the evacuation of the trophoblastic tissue was complete.
4- It is necessary to carry out periodic controls since 40% of the cases will develop a gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Gestational trophoblastic disease should be followed up (regardless of whether the evacuation has been complete or not) and the patient should be advised not to become pregnant again until at least 6 months with negative BHCG titers. The risk of recurrence in another pregnancy is low (1/55) and 90% of cases progress satisfactorily without developing neoplasia.
