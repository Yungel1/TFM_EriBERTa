CLINICAL CASE: 
A 43-year-old woman with a levonorgestrel intrauterine device who consults for lack of rest at night with the appearance of heat and palpitations. In the analytical analysis highlights free T4 10.5 pmol/L (9-19), thyrotropin 2.1 mIU/L (0.30-5.00), FSH 95.6 IU/L (1.38-16.7), LH 21 IU/L (2.4-9.3), estradiol < 0.07 nmol/L (0.07 - 1.14). What is the most appropriate treatment?
1- Benzodiazepines.
2- Vaginal estrogens.
3- Oral estrogens and progestogens in continuous regimen.
4- Transdermal estrogens in a continuous regimen.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
The hormonal profile we are told is in menopausal range (FSH >20; estradiol <5) and the patient has systemic vasomotor symptoms. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to administer systemic estrogens. To compensate, she already has a local uterine progestin (levonorgestrel IUD).
