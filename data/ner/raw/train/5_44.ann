T1	Claim 1198 1211	Esophagectomy
T2	Claim 1126 1194	Periodic surveillance endoscopies and indefinite treatment with PPI.
T3	Claim 634 753	Given that the esophagitis is mild and the dysplasia is low grade, it is advisable to continue treatment with alkalines
T4	Claim 758 952	Indefinite treatment with high doses of PPI since it has been demonstrated that this prevents the progression of Barrett's esophagus to adenocarcinoma, making endoscopic surveillance unnecessary
T5	Claim 957 1121	Periodic surveillance endoscopies and treatment with PPIs for less than 12 weeks, since prolonged treatment is associated with a high risk of gastrinoma development
T6	Claim 1585 1608	The correct answer is 4
T7	Premise 41 124	A 66-year-old man reports daily heartburn since youth, which he treats with alkalis
T8	Premise 126 235	An upper endoscopy shows mild erosive esophagitis and displaced squamous columnar junction approximately 7 cm
T9	Claim 1441 1583	In any case, Barrett's esophagus should follow endoscopic surveillance and lifelong PPI treatment or antireflux surgery to prevent progression
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T6	
T10	Premise 237 406	The esophageal biopsies showed mild erosive esophagitis and a columnar squamous junction displaced approximately 7 cm from the most proximal portion of the gastric folds
T11	Premise 408 565	Biopsies of the distal esophagus reveal that the normal squamous epithelium has been replaced by intestinal-type columnar epithelium with low-grade dysplasia
T12	Premise 1231 1297	This patient presents Barrett's esophagus with low grade dysplasia
T13	Claim 1333 1439	not being with acid production inhibition the dysplasia may be conditioned by inflammation and not be real
