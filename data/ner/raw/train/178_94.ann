R1	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T17	
T3	Premise 313 371	The ultrasound examination is compatible with hemarthrosis
T19	Premise 376 460	in the analysis performed only an APTT lengthening of 52″ (normal 25-35″) stands out
R2	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T17	
T20	Claim 826 896	An uncle of his had similar problems, so we suspect hereditary disease

T26	Claim 1087 1145	We are left with von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia A
T27	Claim 1147 1555	I consider that the correct answer is 4, hemophilia A, since the inheritance pattern is X-linked and its main clinical manifestation is soft tissue bruising and spontaneous hemarthrosis, without apparent trauma, while von Willebrand disease is characterized by bleeding after surgery or trauma and a prolonged bleeding time with a normal platelet count is characteristic (data not mentioned in the statement)
