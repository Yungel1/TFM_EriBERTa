QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 59-year-old woman consults a gynecologist for a spontaneous, spontaneous, uniorificial discharge from the right nipple (unilateral) without palpable nodularity. What is the most likely diagnosis?
1- Given the hematic nature of the discharge, the most likely diagnosis is infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
2- Intraductal papilloma.
3- Paget's disease of the nipple.
4- Tumor hyperprolactinemia.
5- Mammography will indicate the diagnosis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The correct answer is 2. In the presence of unilateral and uniorificial hematic telorrhea, the most frequent cause is intraductal papilloma (50%), followed by ductal ectasia and carcinoma. When associated with palpable mass, 60% correspond to carcinoma. Paget's disease is of the eczematous type. In hyperprolactinemia, telorrhea is bilateral and pluriorificial. Mammography often does not show papillomas, being more useful ultrasound and galactography.
