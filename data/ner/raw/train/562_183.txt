QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 45-year-old woman with no history of interest consults for dyspneic sensation of about 4 days of evolution. Examination shows rhythmic tachycardia, without murmurs, and pulmonary auscultation is normal. Arterial blood gases showed a pO2 of 70 mmHg and a pCO2 of 32 mmHg. Hemogram, renal and hepatic function are normal. Prothrombin time 90%, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of 2 to control (N <1.2). Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely:
1- Antiphospholipid syndrome.
2- Factor V of Leiden.
3- Hemophilia.
4- Acute pericarditis.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
In this question what they assume is that this is a 45-year-old woman who is diagnosed with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). With this diagnosis, options 3 and 4 are directly excluded (also, she is female, so we would not have to think about hemophilia) As an analytical data, it says that there is a lengthening of the aPTT. So, they want you to know, she has positive lupus ac and link it directly to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A Leiden's does not alter coagulation, so it is ruled out as well. Anyway, although it is not within the possible answers, lupus positivity can be related to a myriad of clinical situations, syndromes and pathologies. Assuming that a PTE + lupus is a PFS seems to me to be a bit of a stretch, but it is the most likely with the data provided.
