T6	Claim 572 609	It is a post lumbar puncture headache
T7	Claim 614 750	It is necessary to look for a different cause to this headache, because it is not typical of post-lumbar puncture syndrome or meningitis
T8	Claim 755 911	Most likely it was not a viral meningitis, but a subarachnoid hemorrhage. For this reason, the initial headache disappears almost completely when lying down
