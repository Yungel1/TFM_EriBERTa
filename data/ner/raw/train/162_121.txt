QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 52-year-old patient with stage V chronic kidney disease, secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, receives a cadaver donor kidney graft. A 34-year-old brother of his comes to visit him and says he does not know if he has the disease because he has never seen a doctor since he was a teenager. What attitude or test do you think is the most appropriate to recommend at that moment?
1- Genetic mutational and linkage study.
2- Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound.
3- Helical computed axial tomography with iodinated contrast.
4- Abdominal and cerebral MRI.
5- Periodic clinical controls.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The correct answer is: 2. Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound. Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound is undoubtedly the most specific and sensitive test for the diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease and, above all, the cheapest to demonstrate whether or not the patient's sibling has inherited polycystic kidney disease.
