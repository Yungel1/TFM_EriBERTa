QUESTION TYPE: GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 20-year-old woman with a 15-cm solid-cystic ovarian tumor detected by ultrasound after presenting with nonspecific abdominal symptoms. In the histopathological study of the corresponding specimen, teeth, hairs, areas of intestinal epithelium, areas of squamous epithelium (15%) and bronchial epithelium, as well as neuroectodermal and embryonal elements are found in several of the histological preparations. In reference to this case, point out the correct diagnosis:
1- Teratocarcinoma.
2- Immature teratoma.
3- Mature cystic teratoma.
4- Dysgerminoma.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Mature cystic teratoma is a common benign tumor of the ovary in adult women. The tissues that make up the tumor are well differentiated (mature or adult-type); apart from cutaneous structures many other tissues can be seen, particularly in a thickening or spur that eminences into the cavity, in which there are often teeth, cartilage and bone.
