T6	Claim 858 869	1 cannot be
T7	Marker 871 878	because
T8	Premise 879 910	there would be infectious signs
R1	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T6	
T9	Premise 77 175	60-year-old woman, diagnosed with breast cancer treated with surgery and radiotherapy 10 years ago
T10	Premise 177 338	Currently with metastases in the dorsal spine and sacroiliac joint, for which she has received monthly treatment with i.v. zoledronic acid for the last two years
T11	Claim 985 1007	3 seems unlikely to me
T12	Marker 1008 1015	because
T13	Premise 1016 1114	the radiotherapy that the patient received would be oriented on the breast and not on the mandible
R2	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T11	
T14	Premise 340 445	The patient presented spontaneous bone exposure at the level of the mandibular bone of approximately 2 cm
T15	Premise 447 540	There are no signs of acute infection and the gum around the bone exposure is strictly normal
T16	Premise 542 596	The mandibular CT scan shows an area of bone sclerosis
T17	Premise 941 983	bisphosphonates create mandibular necrosis
T18	Marker 933 940	because
T19	Claim 912 932	Answer 2 is possible
R3	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T19	
T20	Premise 1140 1183	it is not a case of dental root involvement
T21	Claim 1116 1135	I rule out number 4

R4	Support Ent1:T20 Ent2:T21	
T23	Claim 1185 1198	5 is possible
T24	Premise 1211 1250	the patient already has bone metastases

T25	Claim 1779 1897	between two possible answers you have to always answer, and between 2 and 5, you have to check 2, which is more likely

T32	Marker 1118 1126	rule out

T35	Marker 1371 1374	but
T36	Claim 1666 1758	The latter seems too simple, and would make me lean more towards 2, but it's not clear to me
