T1	Premise 67 241	A 70-year-old man consults for non-radiating lumbar pain of 1 week's duration, of progressive intensity, accompanied by marked limitation of spinal mobility and febrile fever
T2	Premise 243 286	The lumbar spine X-ray shows no alterations
T3	Claim 356 401	Vertebral crush with computed tomography (CT)
T4	Claim 406 447	Bone metastases with technetium bone scan
T5	Claim 452 514	Vertebral ankylosing hyperostosis with dorsolumbar spine x-ray
T6	Claim 519 582	Pyogenic spondylodiscitis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
T7	Claim 609 636	We suspect spondylodiscitis
T8	Disease 620 636	spondylodiscitis
T9	Premise 639 735	the febrile fever and the limitation of mobility of the spine with the acute course give the key
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T7	
T10	Claim 743 772	the indicated test is the MRI
R2	Support Ent1:T7 Ent2:T10	
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T6	
T11	Claim 774 961	"The most demonstrative test is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is positive even in the first 2 weeks of the picture, which facilitates early diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 90%"
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T10	
T12	Claim 963 1081	Vertebral crushing would be seen in the simple X-ray, as well as vertebral ankylosing hyperostosis and many metastases
T13	Premise 1083 1192	In addition, there is no data in the history pointing to bone metastases (oncologic history, weight loss etc)
