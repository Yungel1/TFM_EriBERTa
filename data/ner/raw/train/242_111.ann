T1	Premise 51 218	A 50-year-old man with chronic bronchitis is admitted for pneumonia with positive blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae, with an MIC to penicillin of 0.0125 mg/l.
T2	Premise 219 275	Treatment was started with penicillin 2 million every 4h
T3	Premise 277 324	On the fifth day, she still has a fever of 38ºC
T4	Claim 387 462	I would change the treatment to ceftriaxone because of its greater efficacy
T5	Claim 467 507	I would add a quinolone to the treatment
T6	Claim 512 557	I would switch to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
T7	Claim 562 611	It would rule out the presence of pleural empyema
T8	Claim 616 694	I would continue with the same treatment, assuming it is simply a timing issue
T9	Premise 714 801	The patient is a man with pneumonia with isolated germ in blood culture and antibiogram
T10	Premise 803 893	According to the data provided, it is a pneumococcus sensitive to penicillin (MIC < 0.125)

T12	Premise 898 992	treatment is started with penicillin at high doses every 4 h, despite which the fever persists
R2	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T12	
T13	Claim 994 1061	If we analyze the case carefully, the treatment should be effective
T14	Claim 1068 1136	the germ is totally sensitive to the drug and the dosage is adequate
T15	Claim 1138 1416	so that high concentrations of the drug should be maintained at all times, remember that the efficacy of beta-lactams is time-dependent and the antibiotic concentrations in blood should be above the MIC permanently to achieve effectiveness and avoid the production of resistance

T20	Marker 1460 1468	probably

T31	Disease 596 611	pleural empyema
T32	Claim 1713 1865	If the dosage had not been adequate and the presence of drug resistance was possible, one option could have been to treat with ceftriaxone at high doses
R9	Support Ent1:T32 Ent2:T4	
T33	Marker 1867 1872	since
T34	Claim 1873 2002	we should remember that streptococcus does not produce beta-lactamase and beta-lactam resistance is produced by another mechanism
