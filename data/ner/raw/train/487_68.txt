QUESTION TYPE: GENETICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
What genetic and reproductive counseling would you indicate to a 30-year-old woman who consults because she is a carrier of a premutation in the FMR1 gene, responsible for Fragile X syndrome, and who wishes to have offspring. Point out the correct answer:
1- All her male children will be carriers and, therefore, will manifest the disease.
2- There is a phenomenon of genetic anticipation, so their offspring will present more severe and earlier symptoms.
3- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex selection of embryos by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the best option for healthy offspring.
4- 50% of her daughters will be carriers, but will not present clinical manifestations of the disease.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Another classic MIR, asked in 2019 and in 2017, fragile X syndrome. Also, on the same concept as question 44, the phenomenon of genetic anticipation. Triplet expansion diseases, such as this one, can have the anticipation phenomenon whereby females with premutations (between 55-200 repeats) can have children with full mutations (more than 200 repeats of the triplet) and more obvious, more severe and/or earlier clinical, in both males and females (Fragile X syndrome, early ovarian failure, tremor/ataxia associated with Fragile X).
