T11	Premise 63 126	A 60-year-old man reports precordial pain after medium exertion
T12	Premise 249 289	Ventricular function is depressed (<30%)
T13	Premise 128 247	Coronary angiography shows significant stenosis in the proximal segments of the three main vessels with good distal bed
T14	Premise 517 644	We are talking about a patient with 3-vessel coronary artery disease and, very importantly, with severe ventricular dysfunction
T15	Claim 646 761	Under these conditions, the treatment of choice would be surgical (myocardial revascularization surgery or by-pass)

T16	Marker 646 668	Under these conditions
T17	Claim 763 892	In the case of a patient with preserved LV function, the choice of surgical vs. percutaneous treatment would be more questionable
T18	Claim 894 1041	since today, thanks to drug-eluting stents, the differences in terms of morbidity and mortality between by-pass surgery and angioplasty are minimal
