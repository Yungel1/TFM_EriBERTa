QUESTION TYPE: ANESTHESIOLOGY, CRITICAL CARE AND EMERGENCIES
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 37-year-old man with no past history of interest comes to the emergency department for syncope while walking. He had started two days earlier with dyspnea on exertion. Examination: weight 75 kg, BP 75/50 mm Hg. SatO2 89%. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic tachycardic tones at 130 bpm. Abdomen normal. Extremities: no alterations. Normal hemogram. Troponin 1.2 ng / ml. ECG: Sensual tachycardia at 130 bpm. Inverted T in V1-V4. Thoracic CT angiography: repletion defect in both main pulmonary arteries. One hour after arrival at the emergency room, BP 70/55 mm Hg persists. What would be the most appropriate initial treatment?
1- Unfractionated heparin, 10,000U iv on clinical suspicion. Fibrinolysis with tPA 100 mg iv once the diagnosis is confirmed.
2- Enoxaparin: 80 mg sc every 12 hours, starting upon diagnostic suspicion.
3- Enoxaparin; 80 mg sc every 12 hours, starting upon diagnostic confirmation.
4- Fondaparinux: 7.5 mg sc daily.
5- Emergency pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
The clinical case is a typical pulmonary thromboembolism. In this case it is associated with persistent arterial hypotension. Option 2 would be correct if the patient were not hypotensive. Option 3 is not correct since diagnostic confirmation is not necessary to initiate anticoagulant therapy in case of PTE without hypotension. Option 4 is not indicated. Option 5 would be correct only if the patient had a contraindication to fibrinolysis. Persistent hypotension in PTE is the most widely accepted indication for fibrinolysis, so the correct option is 1.
