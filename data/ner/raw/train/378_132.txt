QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 72-year-old patient presents with progressive memory loss and word finding difficulty of one year's duration. What is the most useful examination to characterize the type of cognitive deficit he presents with?
1- Neuropsychological evaluation.
2- Brain magnetic resonance imaging.
3- Positron Emission Tomography.
4- Electroencephalogram.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
The characterization of cognitive deterioration processes is still clinical, with imaging tests (MRI or PET) being a support tool in some occasions. The first option would be the correct one because it allows us to measure in a standardized way each of the cognitive domains, which will allow us to frame the patient's deficits in a specific syndrome and to monitor the deterioration with repeated scans over time.
