QUESTION TYPE: NEPHROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 54-year-old man is diagnosed with a left renal tumor suggestive of renal cell carcinoma. His preoperative workup shows elevated levels of GPT, alkaline phosphatase and alpha-2-globulin and prolonged prothrombin time. The liver is diffusely enlarged, but without defects of hepatic infiltration. The most likely rationale for these findings is due to:
1- Hepatic metastases.
2- Intrahepatic tumor thrombosis.
3- Acute hepatitis.
4- Presence of hepatotoxic substances produced by the tumor.
5- Hemochromatosis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
Very easy question in which we are being presented with a patient with Stauffer's syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome consisting of liver dysfunction secondary to toxic products secreted by a number of tumors (most frequently, renal cell carcinoma, like the one in this case). As in this case, cholestasis (elevation of alkaline phosphatase), mobilization of hepatic enzymes and lengthening of the prothrombin time indicate liver dysfunction. Metastases are ruled out (there are no defects of hepatic infiltration), intrahepatic tumor thrombosis (it would give another symptomatology and this would be more acute), and acute hepatitis and hemochromatosis (they are not in context nor is it what the author of the question wants us to think).
