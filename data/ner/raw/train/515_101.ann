T1	Premise 59 153	15-year-old male, admitted after being run over on the public road, resulting in being ejected
T2	Premise 155 247	He was admitted conscious and oriented, with intense pain in the left hemithorax and dyspnea
T3	Premise 249 376	Physical examination showed blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, heart rate 130 bpm, basal oxygen saturation 90%, respiratory rate 35 rpm
T4	Premise 378 458	There is complete hypophonesis in the left hemithorax and dullness to percussion
T5	Premise 460 549	Chest X-ray shows multiple left costal fractures and massive ipsilateral pleural effusion
T6	Premise 551 634	Placement of a pleural drain is indicated, with 1700 cc of hematic fluid coming out
T7	Claim 672 746	Institute noninvasive mechanical ventilation and request blood transfusion
T8	Claim 751 831	Analgesia, oxygen therapy, request blood transfusion and indicate urgent surgery
T9	Claim 836 959	Orotracheal intubation, request blood transfusion and observation for, in case of worsening, indicate surgical intervention
T10	Claim 964 1040	Orotracheal intubation and urgent CT scan for accurate assessment of lesions
T11	Claim 1067 1373	There are two answers that we can immediately rule out if we stick to the initial management of severe chest trauma: 1 (noninvasive ventilation is not indicated because it does not secure the airway) and 3 (observation in these cases, waiting for worsening, only leads to increased morbidity and mortality)

T16	Claim 1800 2250	With the data provided by the question, a patient who seems to be in shock (tachycardia, hypoxemia, tachypnea... although we do not receive data, for example, on lactacidemia), and in whom we have to our knowledge a left thoracic trauma, which not only implies bone injury, but may mask other injuries of high severity and which are not diagnosed with a chest X-ray: myocardial contusion, pericardial effusion, splenic injury, diaphragmatic injury...

T18	Premise 2251 2341	We place a left pleural drain on the patient and obtain a debit of 1700cc of hematic fluid
T19	Treatment 751 760	Analgesia
T20	Claim 2343 2584	If we follow the ATLS (ATLS-Advanced Trauma Life Support 10th edition) guidelines for the care of severely polytraumatized patients, they tell us that an immediate bleeding of more than 1500cc of blood is an indication for urgent thoracotomy

T26	Claim 2595 2737	even in patients with a bleeding of less than 1500cc, if the debit persists at a rate of 200mL/h for 2 to 4h, this indication would also exist
T27	Claim 2739 2815	Therefore, the person who asked the MIR question wants us to answer option 2

T29	Claim 2817 3034	However, in real life, the course of action will depend on the stability of the patient when we have applied the treatments indicated in option 2: adequate analgesia, oxygen therapy and initiation of blood transfusion
T30	Marker 2817 2824	However
T31	Treatment 2964 2982	adequate analgesia
T32	Treatment 2984 2998	oxygen therapy
T33	Treatment 3017 3034	blood transfusion

T34	Claim 3367 3416	In this case, the doubt would arise with option 4
T35	Claim 3418 3642	although, as I say, everything will depend on the clinical stability of the patient and the time we have before achieving definitive control of the hemorrhagic focus (which is, after all, what we are after in this situation)
T36	Marker 3418 3426	although
T37	Claim 3036 3365	If by optimizing the patient we manage to stabilize him and assess that it is safe to transfer him, the performance of a body CT scan will define in much greater detail the lesions he has, and will help to ensure that the surgery he will probably end up undergoing will be a definitive surgery and not just damage control surgery
