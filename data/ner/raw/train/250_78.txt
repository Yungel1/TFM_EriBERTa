QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 55-year-old man, father of a celiac child, with iron-deficiency anemia and a recent increase in the stool rhythm, has been tested negative for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 alleles. Which diagnostic test is the most appropriate in this case?
1- Determination of anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies.
2- Upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies.
3- D-xylose test.
4- Evaluate response to gluten-free diet.
5- Colonoscopy.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
Middle-aged male with iron deficiency anemia and increased number of stools, a colonoscopy should be done to rule out colorectal cancer!!! If the HLA is negative it is very unlikely to be celiac disease (high negative predictive value).
