T6	Premise 329 347	Glycemia 110 mg/dL
T7	Premise 349 432	His severe spinal deformity makes it difficult to perform percutaneous renal biopsy

T24	Claim 800 975	Lupus erythematosus, some vasculitides, Goodpasture's disease and other systemic diseases (ankylosing spondylitis is one of them) affect the kidney and condition its prognosis
T25	Disease 800 819	Lupus erythematosus

T27	Disease 840 861	Goodpasture's disease
T28	Disease 891 913	ankylosing spondylitis
T29	Claim 977 1171	The appearance of urinary abnormalities or renal impairment of parenchymal cause are indications for renal biopsy, even with proteinuria ranges lower than those accepted in primary nephropathies

T30	Marker 1092 1096	even
R4	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T29	
T31	Claim 1173 1355	The determination of anti-GBM antibodies and ANCAS are helpful for diagnosis, but they do not replace renal biopsy, since they lack prognostic value and do not help to plan treatment
T32	Marker 1251 1254	but
T33	Claim 1357 1469	In this case, in which we are led to think that renal biopsy is not possible, we must relate AE to renal failure
T34	Claim 1471 1619	In most cases, the relationship is established by an IgA nephropathy, which presents with hematuria, a symptom that claims not to exist in this case
T35	Disease 1524 1539	IgA nephropathy

T36	Claim 1621 1736	A non-negligible number of patients with evolved AD is amyloidosis, which also matches the patient's symptomatology
T37	Disease 1676 1687	amyloidosis
T38	Claim 1738 1871	Therefore, and given that amyloidosis can be diagnosed with a subcutaneous fat biopsy, it is answer 3 that should be considered valid
