QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 18-year-old patient who comes to the emergency department with epistaxis of several days' evolution, with no personal or family history of interest. On examination he is afebrile, multiple ecchymoses are observed, no splenomegaly is palpable. Laboratory tests: leukocytes 7.2 x103/μL, Hb 12.3 g/dL, platelets 6.0 x103/μL. Thrombocytopenia is confirmed in the smear, where platelets of increased size are observed. Coagulation and biochemistry studies are normal. What do you consider the most likely diagnosis?
1- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
2- Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
3- Thrombocytopenia induced by infection.
4- Primary immune thrombocytopenia.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
This is an easy clinical case only presenting thrombopenia with clinic, petechiae and epistaxis. 1 is false, there would be fever, hemolysis data, neurological symptoms, in the smear there would be schistocytes. In 2 the coagulation must be altered and in this case it is not mentioned.
