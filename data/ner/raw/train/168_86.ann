T1	Premise 69 236	What examination would you advise in the first place for an 82-year-old patient with exertional angina and a systolic ejection murmur of intensity 3/6 on auscultation?
T2	Claim 240 253	A stress test
T3	Claim 258 278	Coronary angiography
T4	Claim 283 306	Exercise echocardiogram
T5	Claim 311 328	Coronary CT scan.
T6	Claim 332 354	Doppler echocardiogram
T7	Diagnostics 240 253	A stress test
T8	Diagnostics 258 278	Coronary angiography
T9	Diagnostics 283 306	Exercise echocardiogram
T10	Diagnostics 311 327	Coronary CT scan
T11	Diagnostics 332 354	Doppler echocardiogram
T12	Claim 374 429	Ejective murmur, our first suspicion is aortic stenosis
T13	Disease 414 429	aortic stenosis
T14	Claim 431 538	Angina may be due to the stenosis itself or to underlying coronary artery disease (probable, given the age)
T15	Claim 540 607	And with this information, we cannot know if the stenosis is severe
T16	Disease 589 597	stenosis
T17	Claim 609 874	Therefore, the first thing we will have to do will be to study the valve disease: we do not want to put the patient to run or overload him with dobuta and have a syncope, nor do we want to do a catheterization without having first performed another noninvasive test
T18	Marker 609 618	Therefore
R1	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T2	
R2	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T4	
T19	Claim 876 995	And cardioTC, in someone 80 years old, is going to tell us what we already know: that he has calcium up to his eyebrows
R3	Attack Ent1:T19 Ent2:T5	
R4	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T6	
R5	Attack Ent1:T17 Ent2:T3
