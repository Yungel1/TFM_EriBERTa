T1	Premise 42 131	A 54-year-old man is diagnosed with a left renal tumor suggestive of renal cell carcinoma
T2	Premise 133 259	His preoperative workup shows elevated levels of GPT, alkaline phosphatase and alpha-2-globulin and prolonged prothrombin time
T3	Premise 261 337	The liver is diffusely enlarged, but without defects of hepatic infiltration
T4	Claim 398 416	Hepatic metastases
T5	Claim 421 449	Intrahepatic tumor thrombosi
T6	Claim 455 470	Acute hepatitis
T7	Claim 475 531	Presence of hepatotoxic substances produced by the tumor
T8	Claim 536 551	Hemochromatosis
T9	Claim 1014 1038	Metastases are ruled out
T10	Premise 1040 1084	there are no defects of hepatic infiltration
R1	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T9	
T11	Claim 1087 1116	intrahepatic tumor thrombosis
T12	Premise 1118 1183	it would give another symptomatology and this would be more acute
R2	Support Ent1:T12 Ent2:T11	
T13	Claim 1190 1225	acute hepatitis and hemochromatosis
T14	Premise 1227 1310	they are not in context nor is it what the author of the question wants us to think
R3	Support Ent1:T14 Ent2:T13	
R4	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T4	
T15	Marker 1029 1038	ruled out
R5	Attack Ent1:T11 Ent2:T5	
R6	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T6	
R7	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T8	
T16	Premise 599 846	we are being presented with a patient with Stauffer's syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome consisting of liver dysfunction secondary to toxic products secreted by a number of tumors (most frequently, renal cell carcinoma, like the one in this case)
T17	Premise 848 1012	As in this case, cholestasis (elevation of alkaline phosphatase), mobilization of hepatic enzymes and lengthening of the prothrombin time indicate liver dysfunction
R8	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T7	
R9	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T7	
T18	Disease 398 416	Hepatic metastases
