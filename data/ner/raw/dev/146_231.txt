QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 7-month-old infant comes to the emergency department referred by his pediatrician for suspected Kawasaki disease. He reports a fever of up to 39.5ºC of 5 days evolution that does not subside despite treatment with amoxicillin prescribed 72 hours ago for suspected acute pharyngotonsillitis. During the last 24 hours he has had erythematous and pruritic exanthema of cephalocaudal evolution and during the last few days his parents have noticed a cough and intense conjunctivitis. No rhinorrhea was reported. Clinical examination showed subcrepitant in both lung bases without tachypnea or signs of respiratory distress. On oropharyngeal examination there are whitish spots in the jugal mucosa. What is the most probable diagnosis?
1- Kawasaki disease.
2- Scarlet fever.
3- Allergic reaction to amoxicillin.
4- Infectious mononucleosis.
5- Measles.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
The correct answer is 5. The clue is in the whitish lesions of the jugal mucosa corresponding to Koplik's spots, which are pathognomonic of measles, although as an observation I would say that they usually appear in the prodromal phase of the disease and are often no longer seen when the exanthema appears. In this case you are describing measles complicated by pneumonia. Very timely question at the present time.
