T1	Premise 69 171	A 26-year-old male patient, competitive athlete, is studied because his brother has had a sudden death
T2	Marker 129 136	because
T3	Premise 173 256	Complementary tests detect the existence of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T4	Diagnostics 173 192	Complementary tests
T5	Disease 217 256	obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
T6	Claim 309 362	Treatment with beta-blockers helps to reduce symptoms
T7	Claim 367 421	Abandonment of competitive sport should be recommended
T8	Claim 426 476	Digoxin is useful to reduce the subaortic gradient
T9	Claim 481 532	Diuretics should be avoided or used with great care
T10	Claim 537 656	Given the hereditary nature of the pathology, a screening study should be performed in the rest of the direct relatives
T11	Claim 676 861	Our myocardium is thicker than it should be, predominantly in the septum, and it is so thick that it obstructs the LV outflow, producing a "functional" stenosis with a pressure gradient
R1	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T11	
T12	Marker 927 943	for this purpose
T13	Claim 863 1067	Our objective will be, first of all, to "relax" the myocardium: for this purpose, a beta-blocker is recommended, whereas digoxin, as a good positive inotrope, increases the gradient and is contraindicated
T14	Marker 976 983	whereas
R2	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T8	
T15	Claim 1069 1173	Sport is not highly recommended, given the increased risk of sudden death associated with this pathology
R3	Support Ent1:T15 Ent2:T7	
T16	Claim 1175 1335	And if we have a fat septum, which protrudes into the LV cavity, it is not advisable to perform volume depletion, since we would also be increasing the gradient
T17	Marker 1289 1294	since
T18	Claim 1337 1475	Regarding number 5, it is true: it is convenient to perform a careful exploration and an ECG in the relatives of patients with hypertrophy
R4	Support Ent1:T18 Ent2:T10	
R5	Support Ent1:T16 Ent2:T9	
T19	Disease 1464 1475	hypertrophy
T20	Diagnostics 1426 1429	ECG
T21	Treatment 481 490	Diuretics
T22	Diagnostics 585 600	screening study
T23	Treatment 426 433	Digoxin
T24	Treatment 309 337	Treatment with beta-blockers
