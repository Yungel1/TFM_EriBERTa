QUESTION TYPE: DERMATOLOGY, VENEREOLOGY AND PLASTIC SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 17-year-old boy with Crohn's disease with colonic involvement of 2 years of evolution, in maintenance treatment with azathioprine, consults for the appearance for 5 days of subcutaneous purplish red, hot, painful, bilateral, pretibial localization nodules, associated with an increase in the number of stools and abdominal pain. The most appropriate approach in this case is:
1- Recommend relative rest and warm cloths on both legs and add antidepressant treatment.
2- Biopsy skin areas away from the injured areas and prescribe entry opioid analgesics.
3- Suspect the existence of a malignant intestinal tumor lesion as a trigger of the cutaneous process.
4- Suspect bilateral lower extremity ischemia of drug origin.
5- Adjustment of bowel disease treatment.
CORRECT ANSWER: 5
2 and 4 are discarded alone. They are explaining erythema nodosum, so we would recommend relative rest (but antidepressants do not make any sense, so we also rule out (1)). Although erythema nodosum can be secondary to a malignant process, it is more frequent that it is due to Crohn's disease itself (moreover, in a 17-year-old boy it would be extremely rare), so if the picture is also accompanied by a flare-up of inflammatory bowel disease, the last option (5) seems the most correct.
