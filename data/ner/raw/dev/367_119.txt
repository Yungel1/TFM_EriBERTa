QUESTION TYPE: PNEUMOLOGY AND THORACIC SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 38-year-old nonsmoking woman previously diagnosed with atopic rhinitis presents with a two-month history of intermittent cough and wheezing, predominantly at night. Chest X-ray was normal. Spirometry within the normal range with negative bronchodilator test. Which of the following tests would you request next?
1- Paranasal sinus Rx.
2- Thoracic CT.
3- Methacholine test.
4- Prick test.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
A normal spirometry and a negative bronchodilator test does not exclude asthma, and the patient's clinical picture is highly suggestive of asthma, so a methacholine test would confirm the diagnosis, at least of bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
