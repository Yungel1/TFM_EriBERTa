T1	Premise 45 133	A 67-year-old man, diabetic and asthmatic, with primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes
T2	Premise 135 216	He has an ocular pressure of 34 mmHg in his right eye and 31 mmHg in his left eye
T3	Claim 331 360	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
T4	Claim 365 378	Beta-blockers
T5	Claim 383 399	Alpha-2 agonists
T6	Claim 404 429	Prostaglandin derivatives
T7	Claim 456 514	We are asked about the first choice treatment for glaucoma
T8	Claim 516 674	In the past, beta-blockers were the first choice, but nowadays they have been displaced by the group that lowers intraocular pressure the most: prostaglandins
R1	Attack Ent1:T8 Ent2:T4	
T9	Marker 566 569	but
R2	Support Ent1:T8 Ent2:T6	
T10	Claim 676 770	Their efficacy and more convenient dosage (once a day) generally make them the group of choice
R3	Support Ent1:T10 Ent2:T8	
T11	Claim 772 953	Beta-blockers would remain as a second choice in cases in which the side effects of prostaglandins (change in eye color, increase in eyelash size) make us initially leave them aside
R4	Support Ent1:T11 Ent2:T8	
T12	Claim 955 1036	Since the patient is asthmatic, we should rule out beta-blockers (wrong answer 2)
T13	Marker 955 960	Since
R5	Support Ent1:T1 Ent2:T12	
R6	Attack Ent1:T12 Ent2:T4	
T14	Treatment 529 542	beta-blockers
T15	Treatment 660 674	prostaglandins
T16	Marker 997 1005	rule out
T17	Treatment 1006 1019	beta-blockers
T18	Treatment 772 785	Beta-blockers
T19	Claim 1038 1242	Also, since we need a significant drop in intraocular pressure because the numbers are high (34 and 31), we can also rule out carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and alpha-2 agonists (options 1 and 3 incorrect)
T20	Marker 1038 1042	Also
T21	Marker 1044 1049	since
T22	Marker 1155 1163	rule out
T23	Treatment 1164 1193	carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
T24	Treatment 1198 1214	alpha-2 agonists
R7	Attack Ent1:T19 Ent2:T3	
R8	Attack Ent1:T19 Ent2:T5	
T25	Claim 1244 1310	And opt for the group that can lower intraocular pressure the most
T26	Claim 1312 1329	Answer 4 correct.
R9	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T26	
R10	Support Ent1:T26 Ent2:T6	
T27	Treatment 331 360	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
T28	Treatment 365 378	Beta-blockers
T29	Treatment 383 399	Alpha-2 agonists
T30	Treatment 404 429	Prostaglandin derivatives
