QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 1-month-old infant comes to the hospital emergency department referred by his pediatrician for jaundice. He reports jaundice for 10 days and it has been increasing. The blood test showed a total bilirubin of 7mg/dl with an indirect bilirubin of 1.5mg/dl. The most probable cause, among the following, of this jaundice is:
1- Bile duct atresia.
2- Breastfeeding jaundice.
3- Late onset 0-A isoimmunization.
4- Gilbert's disease.
5- Hereditary spherocytosis.
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
The increase in direct bilirubin immediately rules out the rest of the options where the increase in total bilirubin would be at the expense of indirect bilirubin. Bile duct atresia is the main indication for infant liver transplantation.
