An 80-year-old man is brought to the ER by the police to find him at night, on the street, several blocks from his home, somewhat lost. He tells the ER doctor "I feel fine, I was walking and I got lost". The examination, by systems, is anodyne. When asked about his medication, he does not remember. His history includes glipizide, atenolol and acenocoumarol. She has been to the ER 3 times in the last three months for "dizziness", low back pain and an INR of 5. She reports independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. There is no evidence of family or close friends.

He refuses to answer Minimental's questions. Laboratory tests include 13,000 leukocytes, blood glucose 300, glycosylated hemoglobin 11%, INR 0.9, urine over 50 leukocytes/field, nitrites+ and urine culture > 100,000 Gram negative bacilli.

CORRECT ANSWER: 2
Assessing capacity is not about taking away the patient's autonomy, but making sure that the patient understands and is aware of the consequences of his decisions. In fact, it is a protective measure for the most fragile patients to ensure the best care. This is not done by a psychiatrist, but by the attending physician. There are several tests or semi-structured interviews to assess the capacity of patients, and all physicians should be familiar with these instruments. It is important that it is the attending physician who performs this assessment, because he/she is the one who previously informs the patient (informed consent) of the therapeutic plan and is the one who is best able to assess whether the patient has understood everything: what the medical problem is, what treatment is proposed, the alternatives if any, whether to accept or reject any of them and why, the consequences of making these decisions (also those of not wanting treatment), even assessing psychopathology susceptible to an ICP to Psychiatry.
