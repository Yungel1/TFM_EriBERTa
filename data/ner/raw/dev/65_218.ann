T1	Claim 505 564	Biopsy should be repeated to see if the changes are diffuse
T2	Diagnostics 505 511	Biopsy
T3	Claim 569 627	Diagnosis is hepatic glycogenosis associated with diabetes
T4	Disease 582 627	hepatic glycogenosis associated with diabetes
T5	Claim 632 707	Histological changes are irreversible and will eventually lead to cirrhosis
T6	Disease 698 707	cirrhosis
T7	Claim 712 781	The injury is clearly caused by alcohol despite the patient's refusal
T8	Claim 786 897	It is important to reduce weight and adequately control diabetes to avoid the possible development of cirrhosis
T9	Treatment 805 817	reduce weigh
T10	Treatment 823 850	adequately control diabetes
T11	Disease 888 897	cirrhosis
T12	Premise 52 139	A 56-year-old man, diabetic and moderately overweight, presents a discrete hepatomegaly
T13	Premise 141 196	The patient indicates that he is not a regular drinker,
T14	Premise 241 331	A liver biopsy shows accumulations of clear cytoplasmic vacuoles in 50% of the hepatocytes
T15	Premise 333 457	Multiple inflammatory foci with neutrophils, Mallory's hyaline degeneration and fibrosis around the terminal hepatic venules
T16	Claim 1917 1949	we are left with answer number 5
T17	Claim 917 1010	The changes described in the question statement correspond to an early precirrhotic situation
R1	Support Ent1:T17 Ent2:T8	
T18	Claim 1012 1116	Although alcohol is the most frequent toxicant that causes this condition, it is not the exclusive cause
T19	Marker 1012 1020	Although
T20	Claim 1118 1332	Diabetes mellitus causes similar hepatic alterations: fat accumulation in hepatocytes, centroacinar fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrate by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and hyaline degeneration of perinuclear mallory
T21	Claim 1366 1560	we can rule out the second question (they are intracellular fat accumulations, not glycogen) and the fourth (if diabetes also produces this situation, there is no reason to mistrust the patient)

T22	Claim 1685 1794	it is not necessary to repeat a liver biopsy that would not expand information, discarding the first question
R6	Attack Ent1:T22 Ent2:T1	
T23	Premise 1562 1683	Based on the primum non nocere and not having special relevance for the treatment if it is a focal or generalized disease
R7	Support Ent1:T23 Ent2:T22	
T24	Marker 1914 1916	so
T25	Claim 1796 1912	Fortunately for the hypothetical patient, in the initial phase these changes are reversible when the noxa disappears
