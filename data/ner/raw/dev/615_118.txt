QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 41-year-old male consults for gonalgia of several days' evolution. During the examination, the Thessaly test is performed (pain with internal and external rotation movements with the knee flexed), which is positive. Which of the following lesions is more probable?
1- Meniscal injury.
2- Injury due to rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.
3- Injury due to rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament.
4- Injury due to degenerative arthropathy.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
Answer 1 correct: The Thessaly test is a meniscal exploration maneuver. The statement focuses exclusively on this part of the examination and also explains that it is indeed positive, which leads to the suspicion of a meniscal lesion. "The Thessaly test is a dynamic reproduction of load transmission in the knee joint and is performed at 5° and 20° of flexion. The examiner supports the patient by holding his or her outstretched hands while the patient stands flatfooted on the floor. The patient then rotates his or her knee and body, internally and externally, three times, keeping the knee in slight flexion (5°). Then the same procedure is carried out with the knee flexed at 20°. Patients with suspected meniscal tears experience medial or lateral joint-line discomfort and may have a sense of locking or catching. The theory behind the test is that, with this maneuver, the knee with a meniscal tear is subjected to excessive loading conditions and almost certainly will have the same symptoms that the patient reported. The test is always performed first on the normal knee so that the patient may be trained, especially with regard to how to keep the knee in 5° and then in 20° of flexion and how to recognize, by comparison, a possible positive result in the symptomatic knee." Answer 2 incorrect: At no time do they describe any exploration maneuvers of the anterior cruciate ligament, nor do they mention any trauma that may have injured it. Answer 3 incorrect: At no time do they describe any exploration maneuvers of the posterior cruciate ligament, nor do they mention any trauma that could have injured it. Wrong answer 4: Although it could occur, it is not to be expected in a 41 year old person with an acutely established clinical condition.
