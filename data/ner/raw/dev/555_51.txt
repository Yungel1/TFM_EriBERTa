QUESTION TYPE: ENDOCRINOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
55-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes diagnosed at age 15 years who refers nausea and abdominal distention, especially after meals. Evaluation is consistent with diabetic gastroparesis. Which of the following medications would be the most appropriate treatment to improve her symptoms:
1- Lansoprazole.
2- Ondansetron.
3- Loperamide.
4- Metoclopramide.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
It was approved as a treatment for gastroparesis by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1979 and remains the first-line drug. It acts as a prokinetic by its antagonistic effect on dopamine 2 (D2) receptors promoting gastric emptying and, in addition, binds to the 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor (serotonin 5-HT4) to stimulate cholinergic nerve pathways in the stomach. Physiologically, it accelerates intestinal transit by increasing the tone and amplitude of gastric contractions, increases lower esophageal sphincter pressure and improves antropyloroduodenal coordination. In addition, this antiemetic agent provides relief through antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors.
