T1	Premise 42 149	A 75-year-old woman on sertraline treatment who comes to the emergency department with confusional symptoms
T2	Premise 151 209	There is no evidence of edema and blood pressure is 130/70
T3	Premise 211 320	The blood test shows Na 126 mEq/l and K 4 mEq/l, natriuria is 45 mEq/l and diuretic intake has been ruled out
T4	Claim 378 456	It is Addison's disease and corticosteroids should be administered immediately
T5	Claim 461 529	Administer hypertonic saline to restore natremia as soon as possible
T6	Claim 534 625	Indicate water restriction and if natremia does not rise, switch to slow infusion of saline
T7	Claim 630 688	Request brain MRI, since it is probably diabetes insipidus
T8	Marker 311 320	ruled out
T9	Claim 715 939	We are presented with a patient with moderate euvolemic hyponatremia, suggesting a syndrome of inadequate antidiuresis (SIAD) secondary to sertraline, although it would be necessary to have urinary osmolality to confirm this
T10	Marker 866 874	although
T11	Disease 752 783	moderate euvolemic hyponatremia

R2	Support Ent1:T3 Ent2:T9	
T12	Disease 798 840	syndrome of inadequate antidiuresis (SIAD)
T13	Claim 941 1004	Primary adrenal insufficiency produces hypovolemic hyponatremia
R3	Attack Ent1:T13 Ent2:T4	
T14	Claim 1006 1024	incorrect option 1

R5	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T13	
R6	Support Ent1:T13 Ent2:T14	
T16	Claim 1027 1118	Diabetes insipidus is the opposite of this pathology, usually presenting with hypernatremia
T17	Claim 1120 1138	option 4 incorrect
T18	Diagnostics 638 647	brain MRI
T19	Treatment 406 421	corticosteroids
T20	Marker 649 654	since
T21	Disease 670 688	diabetes insipidus
R7	Attack Ent1:T16 Ent2:T7	
T22	Disease 1105 1118	hypernatremia

R10	Attack Ent1:T9 Ent2:T16	
T24	Claim 1141 1275	The question remains whether to treat aggressively with hypertonic saline, or to be more conservative by indicating hydric restriction
T25	Claim 1277 1433	With natremia above 125 mmol/l it is not indicated to treat with HSS unless the patient has severe neurological symptoms, which does not seem to be the case
T26	Marker 1346 1352	unless
R11	Attack Ent1:T25 Ent2:T5	
T27	Treatment 472 489	hypertonic saline
T28	Treatment 1197 1214	hypertonic saline
T29	Treatment 1342 1345	HSS
T30	Treatment 1257 1275	hydric restriction
T31	Premise 1435 1470	they describe a confusional picture
T32	Claim 1471 1523	that would be a moderate hyponatremic encephalopathy
R12	Support Ent1:T31 Ent2:T32	
R13	Support Ent1:T32 Ent2:T25	
T33	Claim 1530 1641	it is not indicated to restore natremia as soon as possible (due to the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome)
T34	Marker 1591 1597	due to
T35	Claim 1643 1683	Therefore, the correct answer would be 3
T36	Marker 1643 1652	Therefore
R14	Support Ent1:T33 Ent2:T25	
R15	Support Ent1:T25 Ent2:T35	
R16	Support Ent1:T35 Ent2:T6	
T37	Claim 1685 1824	What I do not like about this answer is that the second part ("if natraemia does not rise, switch to slow infusion of saline") is incorrect
T38	Claim 1826 1918	since in this case the use of furosemide, tolvaptan or urea should be considered, not saline
T39	Marker 1826 1831	since
R17	Support Ent1:T38 Ent2:T37	
T40	Claim 1920 2006	and it does not indicate tonicity either, since isotonic is not the same as hypertonic
R18	Support Ent1:T40 Ent2:T37	
T41	Marker 1962 1967	since
T42	Claim 2009 2069	In any case, I do not see it as very likely to be overridden
T43	Treatment 543 560	water restriction
