QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
26-year-old woman diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, on treatment with hydroxychloroquine, who consults for a feeling of generalized weakness that has progressively set in over the last 15 days. The physical examination reveals cutaneous pallor and the CBC shows Hb 7.4 g/dL, Hct 31%, MCV 108. Which of the following determinations will be most useful in deciding the course of action?
1- Haptoglobin.
2- Coombs test.
3- Vitamin B12.
4- Antinuclear antibodies.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
In this question, we are presented with a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. For this, the best option would be to request reticulocytes, however, as it is not among the options, we should request a Coombs' test, so the correct answer is 2. Although they want to confuse us with a MCV 108, so that we think of a megaloblastic anemia, the MCV is not excessively high, the onset of anemia in our patient has been rapid and would not fit with SLE or the form of presentation. Antinuclear antibodies are used for diagnosis, but not for monitoring SLE.
