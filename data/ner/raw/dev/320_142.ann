T1	Premise 44 192	A 40-year-old man, with no history of interest, presents with acute arthritis of the right knee of 5 days of evolution as well as fever up to 37.7°C
T2	Premise 194 221	He has no history of trauma
T3	Premise 223 314	He presented with joint effusion, warmth on palpation and functional limitation due to pain
T4	Premise 316 421	Diagnostic arthrocentesis was performed and showed 30000 cels/microliter with predominance of neutrophils
T5	Marker 642 647	FALSE
T6	Premise 423 530	Polarized light examination revealed rhomboidal and cylindrical crystals with weakly positive birefringence
T7	Premise 532 631	On plain radiograph of the knee, radiodense deposits are found in the external meniscus of the knee
T8	Claim 659 771	Initial treatment will consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as aspiration of synovial fluid
T9	Claim 776 860	It is advisable to perform a synovial fluid culture to rule out infectious synovitis
T10	Claim 865 1010	Once the acute flare-up has passed, treatment with allopurinol should be started to reduce the incidence of new arthritis flare-ups in the future
T11	Claim 1015 1120	The most likely diagnosis is acute arthritis due to calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (pseudogout)
T12	Claim 1147 1172	It is a chondrocalcinosis
T13	Claim 1174 1282	There is no treatment for this disease, only treatment for flare-ups (colchicine, NSAIDs or corticosteroids)

T15	Marker 1284 1292	although
