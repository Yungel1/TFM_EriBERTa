T6	Disease 550 607	Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma
T7	Premise 77 149	76-year-old woman with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus on metformin
T8	Premise 151 318	She comes to the emergency room because for 3 days she presents fever of 38ºC, polyuria, dysuria, intense thirst and progressive decrease in the level of consciousness
T9	Premise 320 426	Physical examination showed signs of dehydration, BP 95/54 mm Hg and no signs of neurological localization
T10	Premise 428 510	The CBC shows leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL and blood glucose of 855 mg/dL
T11	Disease 612 627	Cardiac failure
T12	Disease 632 649	Subdural hematoma
T13	Disease 654 679	Obstructive renal failure
T14	Disease 684 715	Diabetic ketoacidosis with coma
T15	Premise 735 993	The question relates the case of a type 2 diabetic patient with hyperglycemia and decreased level of consciousness without neurological focality in the context of a urinary tract infection and who has developed acute renal failure of probable prerenal origin
T16	Claim 995 1028	Option 2 is immediately ruled out
T17	Marker 1019 1028	ruled out
T18	Marker 1029 1036	because
T19	Premise 1037 1085	the clinical picture is not one of heart failure
R1	Support Ent1:T19 Ent2:T16	
R2	Attack Ent1:T16 Ent2:T2	
T20	Claim 1087 1113	Option 3 is also discarded
T21	Marker 1114 1121	because

T29	Marker 1254 1261	because
T30	Marker 1381 1388	because
T31	Premise 1262 1355	obstructive renal failure does not give polyuria, dysuria or the rest of the clinical picture
R5	Support Ent1:T31 Ent2:T25
