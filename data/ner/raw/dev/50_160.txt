QUESTION TYPE: PEDIATRICS
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 5-year-old girl, completely asymptomatic, who comes to the pediatrician for a regular check-up. She consults because her mother was operated on for a thyroid tumor and a grandmother died 10 years ago from a pheochromocytoma. The priority therapeutic attitude we will adopt will be:
1- Exhaustive physical examination with blood pressure control to assess whether the child may have a familial disease.
2- Biochemical analysis with calcitonin. If it is normal, no further control is necessary at this age.
3- Annual monitoring of calcitonin levels with pentagastrin stimulation and, if elevated, indication of prophylactic thyroidectomy.
4- Genetic study of the RET c634 proto-oncogene mutation, and if positive, prophylactic radical thyroidectomy will be performed at this age.
5- Genetic study of the RET c634 proto-oncogene mutation, calcitonin levels and FNA (fine needle aspiration) and if positive, radical thyroidectomy will be performed.
CORRECT ANSWER: 4
The correct answer is 4. It seems to me to be more of an endocrine question than a pediatric question. Proto-oncogene carriers usually have early thyroid tumors so radical thyroidectomy is usually recommended before the age of 5 years. Obviously I had to look this up...it is not very common in our routine practice.
