QUESTION TYPE: GENETICS AND IMMUNOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
An 8-year-old girl (index case) is clinically diagnosed as having neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Recklinghausen's disease with multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules. Her father (not diagnosed with NF1) died in a traffic accident at the age of 38 years. On examination, the mother presents two café-au-lait spots and attends the genetic counseling consultation with her new partner where a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is proposed. Is PGD indicated in this case?
1- Yes, as the mother has 2 café-au-lait spots, she is a carrier and PGD is indicated with these data.
2- It is indicated after detection of the causative mutation in the index case and eventually in his mother.
3- It is not indicated because NF1 responds to mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2), with recessive inheritance.
4- No, two café-au-lait spots are not diagnostic and your new partner is very unlikely to be a carrier (NF1 is a rare disease).
5- With these data, PGD is indicated, consisting of selecting embryos in vitro, to implant in the maternal uterus those without the mutation.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
The first step is to detect the mutation and once detected, if the mother is a carrier, to proceed with PGD.
