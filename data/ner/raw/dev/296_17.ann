T16	Claim 1753 1840	although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option

T18	Claim 1921 2052	the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms

T22	Claim 1842 1919	That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture
T23	Claim 2133 2243	pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image

R4	Attack Ent1:T23 Ent2:T7	
T25	Claim 2245 2324	Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax
T26	Claim 2492 2560	the clearest option goes for pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia
