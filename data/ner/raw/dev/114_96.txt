QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 43-year-old woman consults her primary care physician for fatigue, gingivorrhea and petechiae. Laboratory tests showed anemia of 8 g/dL, thrombopenia of 4000/microliter and leukopenia of 1200/microliter with absolute neutropenia. The coagulation study showed APTT elongation (43″), decreased prothrombin activity (55%), hypofibrinogenemia (98 mg/dl) and presence of high concentration of D-Dimer and fibrin monomers. She is referred for urgent hematologic workup and a bone marrow aspirate is performed showing massive infiltration by immature elements with cleaved nuclei and Auer rods in the cytoplasm. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
1- Chronic myeloid leukemia.
2- Acute promyelocytic leukemia.
3- Acute monoblastic leukemia.
4- Chronic lymphoid leukemia.
5- Acute lymphoid leukemia.
CORRECT ANSWER: 2
After reading such a long statement, running out of breath, going over it and getting overwhelmed, it is time to take a look at it and grasp at something very characteristic. A woman with pancytopenia. A bone marrow showing massive infiltration by immature elements that are proliferating non-stop...with Auer's canes? Acute promyelocytic leukemia. Those rods are the fusion of primary granules of developing myelocytes. Robin&Cotran say so on page 696 of their book "General Pathology" [1]. It is also said by Carr and Rodak in their book "Atlas of clinical hematology" on page 157 [2].
