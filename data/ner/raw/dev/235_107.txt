QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A 71-year-old man presenting with severe pancytopenia without presence of immature cells and with a bone marrow study suggestive of severe aplastic anemia. What would be the fundamental therapeutic approach?
1- Treatment with methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g/kg/day for 5 days.
2- Study of siblings and if any of them is HLA compatible, allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors.
3- Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and antithymocyte immunoglobulin.
4- Hemotherapy support.
5- Chemotherapy and if response autologous transplantation of hematopoietic progenitors.
CORRECT ANSWER: 3
Severe aplastic anemia and not a candidate for allogeneic transplant because of his age. Antisuppressants seem to be the most suitable.
