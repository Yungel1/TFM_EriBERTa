T1	Premise 48 195	A 52-year-old man with no concomitant diseases comes to the emergency department for melena of 24 hours evolution without hemodynamic repercussions
T2	Premise 197 250	He denies taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
T3	Premise 252 321	The hematocrit is 33% and the rest of the laboratory tests are normal
T4	Premise 323 605	The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed urgently 6 hours after admission shows a normal stomach, without blood or hematic debris and an excavated ulcer of 8 mm in diameter in the anterior face of the duodenal bulb with "visible vessel" at its base and without active bleeding
T5	Claim 653 907	In the initial endoscopy it is indicated to apply an endoscopic therapy and subsequently to establish endovenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor. This strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic recurrence and mortality
T7	Claim 912 1155	In the initial endoscopy, given the absence of active bleeding, endoscopic therapy is not indicated. Subsequently, to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic recurrence, intravenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor should be started
T6	Claim 1160 1328	n initial endoscopy, endoscopic therapy is indicated. Subsequent treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor has not been shown to be of any additional benefit
T8	Claim 1333 1481	Since this is a complicated ulcer (hemorrhage) the best therapeutic option, once the hemorrhagic episode is resolved, is a vagotomy and pyloroplasty
T9	Claim 1508 1590	This is a grade IIa ulcer (Forrest classification), with a high risk of recurrence
T10	Claim 1592 1765	Therefore, endoscopic treatment and hospitalization with intravenous treatment with PPIs (in our setting it is usually omeprazole) for at least 72 hours is clearly indicated
T11	Marker 1592 1601	Therefore
R1	Support Ent1:T9 Ent2:T10	
T12	Claim 1767 1851	Surgery is indicated in massive bleeding or bleeding refractory to medical treatment

R2	Attack Ent1:T1 Ent2:T12	
T14	Treatment 1676 1680	PPIs
T15	Treatment 1711 1721	omeprazole
T16	Treatment 706 724	endoscopic therapy
T17	Treatment 755 818	endovenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor
T18	Treatment 976 994	endoscopic therapy
T19	Marker 998 1011	not indicated
T20	Treatment 1073 1137	intravenous treatment with high doses of a proton pump inhibitor
T21	Treatment 1181 1199	endoscopic therapy
T22	Disease 1349 1379	complicated ulcer (hemorrhage)
T23	Treatment 1456 1464	vagotomy
