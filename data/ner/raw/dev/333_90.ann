T1	Premise 45 208	A 35-year-old woman consults for a right thyroid nodule detected incidentally one morning when she observed in the mirror a lump on the anterior aspect of the neck
T2	Premise 210 363	After the pertinent studies, it was decided to operate on the patient, performing a total thyroidectomy with emptying of the central lymph node component
T3	Premise 399 560	the 2.3 cm thyroid nodule was entirely occupied by a papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell variant, without vascular infiltration but with capsular infiltration
T4	Premise 562 628	Thyroglobulin concentrations 24 h after thyroidectomy are 14 ng/mL
T5	Claim 693 768	Refer patient back to surgeon for right laterocervical lymph node stripping
T6	Claim 773 952	Initiate treatment with a dose of TSH-suppressing levothyroxine and schedule for review 6 months later with a new analytical determination of thyroglobulin and cervical ultrasound
T7	Claim 957 1005	Request a PET-CT scan for lymph node involvement
T8	Claim 1010 1198	Delay initiation of TSH replacement-suppressive treatment with levothyroxine and refer the patient to the Nuclear Medicine service for administration of an ablative dose of 100 mCi of I131
T9	Claim 1450 1541	Thyroglobulin is synthesized in the follicular cells and then secreted into the circulation
T10	Claim 1543 1599	therefore, after total thyroidectomy it should disappear
T11	Claim 1601 1690	if this does not occur we must think about the existence of remnants of metastatic tissue
T12	Marker 1543 1552	therefore
