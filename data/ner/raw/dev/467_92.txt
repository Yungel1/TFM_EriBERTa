QUESTION TYPE: ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE: 
A woman presenting with difficulty walking after gynecologic surgery. She has mild thigh pain and leg failure on support. On examination she has weakness in hip flexion and knee extension, and dysesthesias in the anterior aspect of the thigh. What is the most probable diagnosis of suspicion:
1- Femoral nerve neuropathy.
2- Meralgia paresthetica of the femoral cutaneous nerve.
3- Obturator nerve neuropathy.
4- Neuropathy of the sciatic nerve.
5- nan
CORRECT ANSWER: 1
The femoral nerve (although rare) may be damaged in a cesarean section, hysterectomy or lower abdominal operation. This nerve injury produces hypoesthesia and weakness along its distribution. Femoroneuropathy is manifested by paralysis (25% of cases) of the quadriceps muscles, abolition of patellar reflexes and hypoesthesia of the anterior and inner thigh. Therefore, answer 1 is correct. The femoral cutaneous or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2,L3) is only sensitive and is responsible for the sensitivity of the skin of the lateral and anterior aspect of the thigh up to the knee, so it would not explain the motor problem of gait and 2 is false. The obturator nerve (L2-L4) is a mixed nerve. At the motor level, it invests the obturator externus, pectineus, short approximator, the approximators (adductors) and gracilis. At the sensory level the capsule of the coxofemoral joint, medial aspect of the thigh above the knee. Therefore neither affects the sensitivity of the anterior aspect of the thigh nor the extension of the knee so that 3 is false. A lesion of the sciatic nerve at motor level affects to the flexion of the knee not to its extension and at distal level to this one (they do not count anything of distal clinic) and at sensitive level also it is distal in the external face of the leg and in the foot reason why 4 also is false.
